The ``set_pixel`` function call correctly updates the ``working_output`` grid by setting the pixel at row 1, column 0 to color 2 (red). This continues the transformation process by adding another pixel following the alternating color pattern observed in the examples.  However, I still need a comprehensive algorithm to fully implement the mirroring and alternating pattern across the entire shape.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Output Shape:", working_output.shape)
   unique_colors = np.unique(working_output)
   print("Unique Colors:", unique_colors)
   print("Number of color 8 pixels:", np.count_nonzero(working_output == 8))
   print("Number of color 2 pixels:", np.count_nonzero(working_output == 2))

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Output Shape: (8, 11)
   Unique Colors: [0 2 8]
   Number of color 8 pixels: 1
   Number of color 2 pixels: 1

The code shows the working output grid now contains colors 0, 2, and 8.  There is one pixel each of colors 2 and 8.  The next step is to continue building out the transformation, keeping in mind the mirroring and alternating pattern.  This will require a more complex algorithm that is beyond the scope of simple ``set_pixel`` calls.  The algorithm needs to determine the mirrored coordinates and choose colors based on an alternating pattern.  This would likely involve a more sophisticated approach, such as using image processing libraries.
