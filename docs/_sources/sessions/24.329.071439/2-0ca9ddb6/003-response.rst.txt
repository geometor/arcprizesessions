**observations**
This example introduces a magenta cell (color 6), which, like the azure cell in the previous example, remains unchanged in the output. The red (2) and blue (1) cells continue to generate yellow (4) and orange (7) cells respectively, following the established pattern. The magenta cell doesn't seem to influence the placement of any new cells.

Analysis
--------

I will use Python to confirm the positions and counts of each color and the changes between the input and output grids.

Input
^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 9
     height: 9
     colors:
       - 0: 78
       - 1: 1
       - 2: 1
       - 6: 1
     objects:
       - 1x1, position (2,2), color red
       - 1x1, position (5,6), color magenta
       - 1x1, position (7,3), color blue

Output
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
     width: 9
     height: 9
     colors:
       - 0: 70
       - 1: 1
       - 2: 1
       - 4: 4
       - 6: 1
       - 7: 4
     objects:
       - 1x1, position (2,2), color red
       - 1x1, position (5,6), color magenta
       - 1x1, position (7,3), color blue
       - 1x1, positions (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3), color yellow
       - 1x1, positions (6,3), (7,2), (7,4), (8,3), color orange

Differences
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: 8
     colors_changed: added colors 4 and 7 (yellow and orange)
   transformation:
     - new yellow cells appear in cross shape around red cell with distance 2
     - new orange cells appear in cross shape around blue cell with distance 1
     - magenta cell remains unchanged and doesn't influence new cell placement

Transformation
--------------

This example reinforces the previously observed pattern. Red cells generate yellow cells two cells away in the cardinal directions, and blue cells generate orange cells one cell away in the cardinal directions. Cells of other colors (magenta in this case) are unaffected by the transformation and do not influence the placement of new cells.

The natural language program remains consistent:

**For each red cell, place yellow cells two cells away in the north, south, east, and west directions unless the position is already occupied by a non-zero cell. For each blue cell, place orange cells one cell away in the north, south, east, and west directions unless the position is already occupied by a non-zero cell.**
