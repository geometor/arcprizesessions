The working output grid was initialized with all cells set to color 0 (white) which is the standard initialization. The next steps will involve updating this grid according to the predicted output: ``[[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]``. This means the first column will be filled with color 9 (maroon), the second column with color 5 (gray), and the third column with color 4 (yellow).

To apply these changes to the working output grid, we need to set the corresponding cell values based on the transformation rule. The predicted output grid matches the expected output based on the natural language program and the consistent color mappings identified during the rumination phase. 

I will proceed to update the grid with the colors defined in the predicted output: column 1 to color 9, column 2 to color 5, and column 3 to color 4. No further code execution is needed at this point as the transformation is a straightforward application of the determined color mapping.

function_call:
set_cells
{'color': 9, 'grid': [[9, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0]]}
function_call:
set_cells
{'color': 5, 'grid': [[9, 5, 0], [9, 5, 0], [9, 5, 0]]}
function_call:
set_cells
{'color': 4, 'grid': [[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]}
