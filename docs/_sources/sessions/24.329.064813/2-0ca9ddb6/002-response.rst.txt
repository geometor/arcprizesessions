The input grid is a 9x9 grid. It contains a few colored pixels against a white background. There's an azure (8) pixel, two red (2) pixels, and two blue (1) pixels.  The output grid shows the same colored pixels as the input, but with added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels surrounding the blue and red pixels in specific patterns. The patterns are consistent with the previous example: yellow crosses around red pixels, and 3x3 orange squares surrounding blue pixels.

     colors:
       - 0: 60
       - 1: 2
       - 2: 2

       - size: 1x1, position: (2,6), color: red
       - size: 1x1, position: (7,1), color: red
       - size: 3x3, position: (2,2), color: blue surrounded by orange and yellow
       - size: 3x3, position: (5,5), color: blue surrounded by orange and yellow

   differences:
     cells_changed: 22
     colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels around blue pixels; yellow cross pattern around red pixels
   transformation:
     - Blue pixels are surrounded by a 3x3 square of orange pixels, with yellow pixels in the corners.
     - Red pixels have a cross pattern of yellow pixels around them.

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous one.  Each blue pixel is surrounded by a 3x3 square of orange (7) pixels, and the yellow (4) pixels are added to form a cross pattern around each red (2) pixel. The azure (8) pixel remains unchanged.
