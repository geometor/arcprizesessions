**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is identical except one azure pixel has changed to blue (1). The blue pixel is adjacent to, and below, a cluster of azure pixels.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at coordinates: {diff}")
   print(f"Input grid shape: {input_grid.shape}")
   print(f"Number of azure pixels in input: {np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 8)}")
   print(f"Number of blue pixels in output: {np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 1)}")






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Differences found at coordinates: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))
   Input grid shape: (7, 7)
   Number of azure pixels in input: 6
   Number of blue pixels in output: 2






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.  The blue pixels are adjacent to the remaining cluster of azure pixels.
   transformation:
     - A subset of azure pixels change to blue.  Specifically, azure pixels adjacent to other azure pixels are transformed.  The transformation might depend on the location and size of the cluster.

Based on the analysis, a possible natural language program for the transformation is: "Identify clusters of azure pixels. Change one azure pixel in each cluster to blue, selecting a pixel adjacent to other azure pixels within the cluster. If there's only one azure pixel, leave it unchanged."  This needs further validation with more examples.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
