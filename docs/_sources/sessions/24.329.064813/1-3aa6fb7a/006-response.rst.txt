The working output grid is currently identical to the test input grid.  No changes have been made yet.  To proceed, I need to apply the transformation rules encoded in the refined natural language program (v2) and the associated Python code.

Let's execute the code to transform the test input grid and then review the results.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from collections import deque

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)

       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                   cluster = find_cluster(grid, r, c, visited)
                   if len(cluster) > 1:
                       pixel_to_change = select_pixel(cluster, grid)
                       if pixel_to_change:
                           new_grid[pixel_to_change[0], pixel_to_change[1]] = 1

       return new_grid

   def find_cluster(grid, r, c, visited):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       queue = deque([(r, c)])
       visited[r, c] = True
       cluster = [(r, c)]

       while queue:
           row, col = queue.popleft()
           for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
               nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
               if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:
                   visited[nr, nc] = True
                   queue.append((nr, nc))
                   cluster.append((nr, nc))
       return cluster

   def select_pixel(cluster, grid):
       # Calculate centroid
       x_coords, y_coords = zip(*cluster)
       centroid_x = np.mean(x_coords)
       centroid_y = np.mean(y_coords)

       # Find distances from centroid
       distances = [((x - centroid_x)**2 + (y - centroid_y)**2)**0.5 for x, y in cluster]
       max_distance = max(distances)
       farthest_pixels = [cluster[i] for i, dist in enumerate(distances) if dist == max_distance]


       #Prioritize bottom/left among farthest
       best_pixel = None
       min_dist_to_border = float('inf')
       for pixel in farthest_pixels:
           r,c = pixel
           dist = min(r,c, grid.shape[0]-1-r, grid.shape[1]-1-c)
           if dist < min_dist_to_border:
               min_dist_to_border = dist
               best_pixel = pixel


       return best_pixel



   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   transformed_grid = transform_grid(test_input)
   print(f"Transformed Test Grid:\n{transformed_grid}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Transformed Test Grid:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

The code has produced a transformed grid.  Three azure pixels have changed to blue, consistent with the observed pattern in previous examples. The selection seems reasonable based on the algorithm's logic (prioritizing pixels further from the centroid and closer to the edges).  Without a provided solution, it's impossible to definitively confirm its correctness for this specific test case, but the transformation appears plausible given the rules derived from previous examples.

**working output grid**

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

**image**

I cannot display images directly.  The image would show the same grid as represented by the numpy array above, but with the color mapping applied: white (0) for most cells, azure (8) for some, and blue (1) for those locations where the transformation changed the pixel values.
