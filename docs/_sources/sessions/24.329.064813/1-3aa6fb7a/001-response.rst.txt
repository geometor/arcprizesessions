The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is identical except one azure pixel has changed to blue (1). The blue pixel is adjacent to, and below, a cluster of azure pixels.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.  The blue pixels are adjacent to the remaining cluster of azure pixels.
   transformation:
     - A subset of azure pixels change to blue.  Specifically, azure pixels adjacent to other azure pixels are transformed.  The transformation might depend on the location and size of the cluster.

Based on the analysis, a possible natural language program for the transformation is: "Identify clusters of azure pixels. Change one azure pixel in each cluster to blue, selecting a pixel adjacent to other azure pixels within the cluster. If there's only one azure pixel, leave it unchanged."  This needs further validation with more examples.
