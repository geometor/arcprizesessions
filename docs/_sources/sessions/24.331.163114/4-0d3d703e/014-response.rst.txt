The changes to the working output grid are consistent with the *hypothetical* color mapping derived from the examples. The second column of the input grid contains the color 1 (blue), which was mapped to 5 (gray) in the hypothetical mapping. The ``set_range`` function correctly filled the second column of the working output grid with the color 5.

However, it's crucial to reiterate that this mapping is not based on a definitively established rule, but rather an arbitrary choice driven by a lack of clear pattern in the given examples.  The correctness of this mapping (and the resulting output grid) is therefore not guaranteed.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[9, 5, 0],
                              [9, 5, 0],
                              [9, 5, 0]])

   print("Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3],
                         [8, 1, 3],
                         [8, 1, 3]])

   test_mapping = {8: 9, 1: 5, 3: 4}

   test_output = np.array([[test_mapping[x] for x in row] for row in test_input])

   print("\nTest Output (using the same hypothetical mapping):\n", test_output)

   #Check if the second column of working_output matches the second column of test_output
   column_match = np.array_equal(working_output[:, 1], test_output[:, 1])
   print(f"\nSecond column match between working output and test output: {column_match}")

.. code-block::

   Working Output Grid:
    [[9 5 0]
    [9 5 0]
    [9 5 0]]

   Test Output (using the same hypothetical mapping):
    [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]

   Second column match between working output and test output: True






The code confirms that the second column of the ``working_output`` grid matches the second column of the ``test_output`` grid, based on the hypothetical mapping.  Again, this reinforces the consistency of the *hypothetical* mapping, but it doesn't prove its correctness.  The lack of a deterministic rule for determining the correct color mapping remains the primary obstacle.  More examples are essential to solve the puzzle reliably.  The current solution is only partially complete and contingent upon an assumption that may or may not be valid.
