The current working output grid is identical to the test input grid because the ``initialize_output_from_input`` function simply copies the input.  No transformation has been applied yet. To proceed, I need more examples to fully understand and implement the transformation rule, particularly regarding the nuanced definition of adjacency and the role of cluster properties. My current attempts to codify the rule based on only two examples have proven insufficient.  The more examples you provide, the better my ability to discern the pattern and create an accurate solution.
