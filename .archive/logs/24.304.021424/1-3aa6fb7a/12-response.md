The current working grid still has discrepancies compared to the expected output based on the centroid approach. There seems to be inconsistency in how the '1's are added near the clusters.  The heuristic of finding the closest empty cell to the centroid is not perfectly capturing the logic behind the examples.  Let's analyze the output of the centroid algorithm and manually adjust the placement of the '1's to ensure consistency with the examples:



code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def find_clusters(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    cluster_label = 1
    cluster_map = np.zeros_like(grid)

    def dfs(row, col, label):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != 8:
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        cluster_map[row, col] = label
        dfs(row + 1, col, label)
        dfs(row - 1, col, label)
        dfs(row, col + 1, label)
        dfs(row, col - 1, label)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                dfs(r, c, cluster_label)
                cluster_label += 1
    return cluster_map

def add_ones(grid, cluster_map):
    output = np.copy(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    for label in np.unique(cluster_map[cluster_map > 0]):
        rows_cluster, cols_cluster = np.where(cluster_map == label)
        centroid_r = int(np.mean(rows_cluster))
        centroid_c = int(np.mean(cols_cluster))

        min_dist = float('inf')
        best_r, best_c = -1, -1

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if output[r, c] == 0:
                    dist = ((r - centroid_r)**2 + (c - centroid_c)**2)**0.5
                    if dist < min_dist:
                        min_dist = dist
                        best_r, best_c = r, c

        if best_r != -1:
            output[best_r, best_c] = 1

    return output


test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

cluster_map_test = find_clusters(test_input)
output_test = add_ones(test_input, cluster_map_test)
print(output_test)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[0 0 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```
The centroid-based algorithm still misses some '1's. Let's manually correct the output:



function_call: submit

[[1 0 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 1]]
