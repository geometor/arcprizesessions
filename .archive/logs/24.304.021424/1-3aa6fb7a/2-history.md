## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

```text
input:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (43)
    - 8: (5)
  objects:
    - A cluster of 8s in the center-right, starting from row 2, column 2, extending to row 5, column 6.
output:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (42)
    - 8: (5)
    - 1: (2)
  objects:
    - Same cluster of 8s as in the input.
    - Two '1' pixels are added, one to the right of the topmost '8', and one below the bottommost '8'.
differences:
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two '1' pixels are added; the rest are unchanged.
transformation:
  - It appears that the transformation adds a blue (1) pixel to the right of the topmost 8 and below the rightmost 8 in the cluster.  The locations seem relative to the existing 8s.
```

My reasoning: The transformation is quite simple. It identifies a cluster of '8's and adds two '1's in specific positions relative to the cluster's boundaries.  The key is identifying the cluster and its extents correctly.  No other changes are made to the input.
