input:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (37)
    - 8: (13)
  objects:
    - Multiple clusters of 8s.  There are at least four distinct clusters.
    - One cluster is located near top-right (2 pixels).
    - Another in the top-left(2 pixels)
    - A single '8' in the middle-left.
    - A cluster of two 8s in the bottom-left corner.
    - Two '8's in the bottom-left
    - A pair of '8's in the middle-right (row 4, col 4 & 5)
    - A single 8 (row 3, col 4)


output:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (34)
    - 8: (13)
    - 1: (4) # Predicted
  objects:
    - Same '8' clusters as in the input.
    - Four '1' pixels added, one adjacent to each cluster of 8s.


differences:
  cells_changed: 4
  colors_changed: Four '1' pixels added.

transformation:
  - Add one '1' pixel adjacent to each cluster of '8' pixels in the input.  The exact position of each '1' will depend on the cluster's location and shape as observed in previous examples.

Based on the cluster map and the previous examples, I predict the following output:

```python

                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

cluster_map = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
                       [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],

output = np.copy(test_input)

                        continue
                    nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                    if 0 <= nr < output.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < output.shape[1] and output[nr, nc] == 0:
                        output[nr, nc] = 1
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break


print(output)

The code iterates through the cluster map. For each cell belonging to a cluster, it searches for an adjacent empty cell (value 0) and sets it to 1.  The search prioritizes immediate neighbors and stops after the first empty neighbor is found. This approach aims to replicate the heuristic observed in the examples, where the placement isn't entirely deterministic.  The output shows the predicted result.  This is my final answer.
