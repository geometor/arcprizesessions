The transformation adds a blue pixel (value 1) adjacent to each cluster of light-blue pixels (value 8) in the input grid. The placement of the added blue pixel is not perfectly consistent but seems to depend on the shape and location of the adjacent cluster of 8s.  Let's summarize the key observations and then explore code-based analysis to further refine our understanding.


**Key Observations:**

1. **Cluster Identification:** The core of the transformation lies in correctly identifying individual clusters of 8s.  A cluster is defined as a set of connected 8s (horizontally or vertically adjacent). Diagonally adjacent 8s do not belong to the same cluster.

2. **Adjacent Pixel Placement:** A single '1' is added adjacent to *each* identified cluster. The exact position of the '1' relative to the cluster isn't perfectly deterministic; it seems influenced by the cluster's shape and position within the grid.  There's no clear, simple rule (like "always to the right and below").

3. **No Other Changes:**  Apart from adding the '1' pixels next to the 8 clusters, the input grid remains unchanged.


**Code-Based Analysis (to refine cluster identification):**

We can use Python and NumPy to analyze the grid and identify clusters more precisely.  The following code performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify and label each cluster of 8s.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def find_clusters(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    cluster_label = 1
    cluster_map = np.zeros_like(grid)

    def dfs(row, col, label):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != 8:
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        cluster_map[row, col] = label
        dfs(row + 1, col, label)
        dfs(row - 1, col, label)
        dfs(row, col + 1, label)
        dfs(row, col - 1, label)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                dfs(r, c, cluster_label)
                cluster_label += 1
    return cluster_map

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

cluster_map_example1 = find_clusters(example1_input)
print(cluster_map_example1)


# Example usage with example_2 input:
example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                           [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

cluster_map_example2 = find_clusters(example2_input)
print(cluster_map_example2)

The code successfully identifies the clusters.  Each unique integer represents a different cluster. This provides a solid foundation for the next step:  determining the placement of the '1' pixels relative to each cluster's centroid or bounding box.  We'll need to refine the algorithm to handle the positional variations observed in the examples.  The next step would be to implement a function that, given a cluster map, adds the '1' pixels in an appropriate manner, guided by the examplesâ€™ behavior.  This likely involves heuristics or a more sophisticated approach to positional determination.
