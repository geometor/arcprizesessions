## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

```text
input:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (43)
    - 8: (5)
  objects:
    - A cluster of 8s in the center-right, starting from row 2, column 2, extending to row 5, column 6.
output:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (42)
    - 8: (5)
    - 1: (2)
  objects:
    - Same cluster of 8s as in the input.
    - Two '1' pixels are added, one to the right of the topmost '8', and one below the bottommost '8'.
differences:
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two '1' pixels are added; the rest are unchanged.
transformation:
  - It appears that the transformation adds a blue (1) pixel to the right of the topmost 8 and below the rightmost 8 in the cluster.  The locations seem relative to the existing 8s.
```

My reasoning: The transformation is quite simple. It identifies a cluster of '8's and adds two '1's in specific positions relative to the cluster's boundaries.  The key is identifying the cluster and its extents correctly.  No other changes are made to the input.

## observations:

```text
input:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (10)
  objects:
    - Multiple clusters of 8s scattered throughout the grid.  No single, contiguous cluster.
output:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: (37)
    - 8: (10)
    - 1: (3)
  objects:
    - Same 8 clusters as the input.
    - Three '1' pixels added, one next to each cluster of 8s.  The position of each '1' varies depending on the cluster's orientation.
differences:
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three '1' pixels are added.
transformation:
  - For each cluster of 8s (regardless of size or shape), add one 1 adjacent to the cluster. The placement isn't consistently defined for all clusters; the position depends on the relative location of the '8's within each individual cluster.
```

My reasoning: This example confirms the hypothesis from example_1 but extends it. It's not just about the *largest* cluster of 8s, but *each* separate cluster of 8s gets a single '1' added next to it. The placement of the '1' relative to the '8' cluster appears somewhat arbitrary or dependent on the shape of the '8' cluster.  This necessitates a more complex algorithm than the previous assumption.  I'll need to carefully consider how to reliably identify and classify individual clusters of 8s.

In summary, the transformation adds a blue pixel (1) adjacent to each cluster of blue pixels (8) in the input grid.  The placement of the added blue pixel (1) seems dependent on the shape of the adjacent 8 cluster, which complicates the algorithm design to identify and classify these 8 clusters.


# examples summary: 

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
