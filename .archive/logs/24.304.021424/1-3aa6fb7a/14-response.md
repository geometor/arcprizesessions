The current working grid still has inconsistencies.  The centroid approach, while a good starting point, doesn't perfectly capture the placement logic from the examples.  The placement seems to be influenced by factors beyond just proximity to the centroid; the shape and orientation of the cluster seem to play a role.

Let's try a different approach. Instead of relying solely on the centroid, let's check for empty neighbors in a prioritized order: right, down, left, up.  If no empty neighbor is found in this order, we fall back to the closest empty cell.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def find_clusters(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    cluster_label = 1
    cluster_map = np.zeros_like(grid)

    def dfs(row, col, label):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != 8:
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        cluster_map[row, col] = label
        dfs(row + 1, col, label)
        dfs(row - 1, col, label)
        dfs(row, col + 1, label)
        dfs(row, col - 1, label)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                dfs(r, c, cluster_label)
                cluster_label += 1
    return cluster_map

def add_ones(grid, cluster_map):
    output = np.copy(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    for label in np.unique(cluster_map[cluster_map > 0]):
        rows_cluster, cols_cluster = np.where(cluster_map == label)
        centroid_r = int(np.mean(rows_cluster))
        centroid_c = int(np.mean(cols_cluster))

        found = False
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]: # Prioritize right, down, left, up
            nr, nc = centroid_r + dr, centroid_c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and output[nr, nc] == 0:
                output[nr, nc] = 1
                found = True
                break

        if not found:  #Fallback to closest empty cell
          min_dist = float('inf')
          best_r, best_c = -1, -1
          for r in range(rows):
              for c in range(cols):
                  if output[r, c] == 0:
                      dist = ((r - centroid_r)**2 + (c - centroid_c)**2)**0.5
                      if dist < min_dist:
                          min_dist = dist
                          best_r, best_c = r, c
          if best_r != -1:
              output[best_r, best_c] = 1

    return output

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

cluster_map_test = find_clusters(test_input)
output_test = add_ones(test_input, cluster_map_test)
print(output_test)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[0 0 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```
This combined approach still doesn't match the expected output perfectly.  The underlying rule for placement of '1's is proving to be more complex than initially thought.  More examples might reveal more subtle patterns. Let's manually correct the remaining inconsistencies.
