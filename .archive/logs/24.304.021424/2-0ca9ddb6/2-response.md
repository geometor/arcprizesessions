**Example 2:**

**Input:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (66)
  - 1: (2)
  - 2: (2)
  - 8: (1)
objects:
  - single azure (8) at (0,3)
  - single blue (1) at (3,2)
  - single blue (1) at (6,6)
  - single red (2) at (7,1)
  - single red (2) at (2,6)

```

**Output:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (50)
  - 1: (2)
  - 2: (2)
  - 4: (6)
  - 7: (8)
  - 8: (1)
objects:
  - single azure (8) at (0,3)
  - single blue (1) at (3,2)
  - single blue (1) at (6,6)
  - single red (2) at (7,1)
  - single red (2) at (2,6)
  - six yellow (4) forming crosses around red (2) cells
  - eight orange (7) forming crosses around blue (1) cells

```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 14
colors_changed: added yellow (4) and orange (7) around existing colored cells.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1.  A cross pattern of a new color is added around existing colored cells.  Yellow (4) is added around red (2), and orange (7) is added around blue (1).  The pattern extends one cell in each direction (horizontally and vertically).  The presence of multiple colored cells doesn't change the transformation.

**Synthesis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples support the hypothesis that the transformation involves adding a cross pattern of new colors around existing colored cells.  The color added appears to depend solely on the original color's position and not its location.  Red always results in a yellow cross and blue always results in an orange cross.  The transformation appears deterministic and location independent.


**Next Steps:**

To further refine our understanding of the transformation, we need to explore the following:

1.  **More colors:** Test with inputs containing other colors (3-9) to see if the pattern extends to them.
2.  **Edge cases:**  Test with colored cells on the edge and corners to see if the cross pattern is clipped or adjusted in those cases.
3.  **Multiple colors in close proximity:** Introduce two or more colored cells which have their cross patterns overlapping. How is this handled? Does precedence play a role?
4.  **Color combinations:** Test combinations of colors in the input to explore if any interactions take place between the expanded patterns.
