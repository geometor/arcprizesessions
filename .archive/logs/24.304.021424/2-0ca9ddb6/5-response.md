Here's an analysis of the test input, following the established process:

**Input:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (71)
  - 1: (1)
  - 2: (2)
  - 6: (1)
  - 8: (1)
objects:
  - single blue (1) at (2,6)
  - single red (2) at (3,2)
  - single azure (8) at (5,5)
  - single magenta (6) at (7,1)
  - single red (2) at (7,7)
```

**Predicted Output (based on previous examples):**

Based on the established transformation rules, we predict the following output:

1.  A yellow (4) cross will be added around each red (2) cell.
2.  An orange (7) cross will be added around the blue (1) cell.
3.  The azure (8) and magenta (6) cells will remain unchanged.


Let's use code to generate and visualize the predicted output:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

# Apply transformation rules
test_output = np.copy(test_input)

# Add yellow crosses around red cells
red_indices = np.where(test_input == 2)
for i in range(len(red_indices[0])):
    row = red_indices[0][i]
    col = red_indices[1][i]
    test_output[row-1:row+2, col] = np.maximum(test_output[row-1:row+2, col], 4)
    test_output[row, col-1:col+2] = np.maximum(test_output[row, col-1:col+2], 4)


# Add orange crosses around blue cells
blue_indices = np.where(test_input == 1)
for i in range(len(blue_indices[0])):
    row = blue_indices[0][i]
    col = blue_indices[1][i]
    test_output[row - 1:row + 2, col] = np.maximum(test_output[row - 1:row + 2, col], 7)
    test_output[row, col - 1:col + 2] = np.maximum(test_output[row, col - 1:col + 2], 7)



print("Predicted Output:")
print(test_output)

print("Number of each color in predicted output:")
print(np.unique(test_output, return_counts=True))

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Predicted Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 7 7 7 0]
 [0 4 4 4 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]
 [0 6 0 0 0 0 4 4 4]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]]
Number of each color in predicted output:
(array([0, 4, 6, 7, 8]), array([64, 10,  1,  5,  1]))

```

**Final Report:**

**Test Input:**

*   Width: 9
*   Height: 9
*   Colors: 0 (71), 1 (1), 2 (2), 6 (1), 8 (1)

**Predicted Output:**  (as shown in the code output above)

**Transformation:** The transformation is consistent with the previously observed pattern.  Crosses of yellow (4) are added around red (2) cells, and crosses of orange (7) are added around blue (1) cells. Other colors remain unaffected. The code correctly predicts this.

**Verification:** The code's output matches the predicted output based on the observed pattern in previous examples.
