**Example 3:**

**Input:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (73)
  - 1: (1)
  - 2: (1)
  - 6: (1)
objects:
  - single red (2) at (2,2)
  - single magenta (6) at (5,6)
  - single blue (1) at (7,3)
```

**Output:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (65)
  - 1: (1)
  - 2: (1)
  - 4: (4)
  - 6: (1)
  - 7: (4)
objects:
  - single red (2) at (2,2)
  - single magenta (6) at (5,6)
  - single blue (1) at (7,3)
  - four yellow (4) forming a cross around red (2)
  - four orange (7) forming a cross around blue (1)
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 8
colors_changed: added yellow (4) and orange (7)
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation in Example 3 is consistent with Examples 1 and 2.  Yellow (4) is added around red (2), and orange (7) is added around blue (1). The magenta (6) remains unchanged.


**Synthesis of Examples 1, 2, and 3:**

The consistent pattern across all three examples strongly suggests the following transformation rule:

1.  **Identify colored cells:**  Find all cells with values other than 0.
2.  **Add cross patterns:** For each colored cell:
    *   If the cell's color is red (2), add a cross pattern of yellow (4) around it.
    *   If the cell's color is blue (1), add a cross pattern of orange (7) around it.
    *   Other colors remain unchanged.
3.  **Cross pattern:** The cross pattern extends one cell in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the central colored cell.  If the cross pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it is clipped.

This rule explains the changes observed in all three examples.  The rule is deterministic and location-independent, as suggested earlier.


**Next Steps (testing the hypothesis):**

The next steps should focus on testing edge cases and expanding the rule to encompass other colors:

1.  **Edge cases:** Test with input grids where colored cells are placed at the edges or corners of the grid.
2.  **Additional colors:**  Introduce inputs with other colors (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) to determine whether and how the transformation rule extends to them. This will likely require additional examples.
3.  **Overlapping crosses:** Test with input grids where the cross patterns generated for different cells overlap.  We need to establish precedence or resolution rules for such cases.


The hypothesis, based on three examples, appears robust.  However, further testing with the suggested next steps is crucial before asserting its validity.
