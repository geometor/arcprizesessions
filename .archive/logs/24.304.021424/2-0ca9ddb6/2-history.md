## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (73)
  - 1: (1)
  - 2: (1)
objects:
  - single red (2) at (3,2)
  - single blue (1) at (6,6)
```

**Output:**

```
width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (61)
  - 1: (1)
  - 2: (1)
  - 4: (4)
  - 7: (4)
objects:
  - single red (2) at (3,2)
  - single blue (1) at (6,6)
  - four yellow (4) forming a cross around red (2)
  - four orange (7) forming a cross around blue (1)

```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 8
colors_changed: added yellow (4) and orange (7)
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding a cross pattern of a new color around existing colored cells.  The color added depends on the initial color's position.  Specifically:

* A cross of yellow (4) appears around the red (2) cell.
* A cross of orange (7) appears around the blue (1) cell.

The cross pattern extends one cell in each direction (horizontally and vertically) from the central cell.


**Next Steps:**

To confirm this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Additional examples will help determine if the transformation is consistent and if the choice of new colors depends on a rule involving the position of the existing colors or any other factors.  Specifically, we need to examine cases with:

* More than one colored cell in the input.
* Colored cells at the edges or corners.
* Different colors than red and blue in the input.
