Based on the three examples, the transformation consistently involves adding cross patterns around specific colors in the input grid.  The rules appear to be:

1. **Identify colored cells:** Find all cells with values other than 0.

2. **Add cross patterns:** For each colored cell:
    * If the cell's color is red (2), add a yellow (4) cross around it.  The cross extends one cell in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right).
    * If the cell's color is blue (1), add an orange (7) cross around it, extending one cell in each cardinal direction.
    * Other colors (e.g., magenta (6), azure (8)) remain unchanged.

3. **Boundary handling:** If a cross pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it's clipped.  No cells outside the original grid dimensions are affected.

4. **Overlapping crosses:** The examples haven't shown overlapping crosses, leaving this aspect of the rule undefined.  Further examples are needed to determine how overlapping cross patterns are handled (e.g., precedence, superposition, or a different rule).

Let's use code to explore some properties:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 7, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

print("Example 1 - Number of each color in input:")
print(np.unique(example1_input, return_counts=True))
print("Example 1 - Number of each color in output:")
print(np.unique(example1_output, return_counts=True))


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 - Number of each color in input:
(array([0, 1, 2]), array([79,  1,  1]))
Example 1 - Number of each color in output:
(array([0, 1, 2, 4, 7]), array([71,  1,  1,  4,  4]))

```

The code confirms the color counts from the visual inspection.  The output shows the addition of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels as expected.  Further code analysis could focus on automatically detecting the cross patterns and verifying their placement relative to the original colored cells in each example.  This would provide a more robust validation of the hypothesized transformation rules.  A function to identify and extract crosses could be particularly helpful.


Next steps:

1.  Develop a function to automatically detect and analyze cross patterns in a NumPy array, given the center point and color. This will allow for automated verification of the rule across all examples.
2.  Expand code analysis to include all three examples and automatically count color changes.  This will increase confidence in the derived rules.
3.  Generate test cases with overlapping crosses to refine the rules and handle this situation.
4.  Include test cases with colors other than 1, 2 to further validate the rules.


This systematic approach will provide a more thorough understanding of the transformation rules and strengthen the prediction capabilities for future unseen cases.
