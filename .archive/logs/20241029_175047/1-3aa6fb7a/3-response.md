Based on the two examples provided, the transformation rule appears to involve changing certain azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The rule isn't perfectly clear from just two examples, but a strong hypothesis is that an azure pixel changes to blue if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a white (0) pixel.

Let's summarize the observations and use code to analyze the patterns:

**Summary of Observations:**

* **Example 1:**  A single azure pixel in the top-right corner of each 2x2 azure block changes to blue.
* **Example 2:** Multiple azure pixels, specifically those adjacent to white pixels, change to blue.  This suggests adjacency to white is a key factor.

**Code Analysis to Confirm Adjacency Hypothesis:**

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Pixel at (1, 2): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (4, 4): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (1, 4): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (2, 3): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (5, 3): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0

```

The code analysis reveals a flaw in the initial adjacency hypothesis.  The `Unexpected change` messages indicate that the transformation is not solely based on adjacency to white pixels.  The transformation is more complex than initially thought.  More examples are crucial to refine the rule.  The current examples are insufficient to determine a comprehensive and accurate transformation rule.
