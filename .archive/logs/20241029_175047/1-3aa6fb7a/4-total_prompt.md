**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.

**transformation:**
  - It appears that one pixel in the top-right corner of each azure object is changed to blue.  Further examples are needed to confirm this pattern and to determine whether this transformation applies to azure objects of other sizes or positions.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**code_execution:**


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                       [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],

                       [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
print(f"{diff_grid=}")

```

  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 10
  objects:
    - size: 2x2, position: (4,4), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (6,3), color: azure
    - size: 2x2, position: (6,3), color: azure


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 37
    - 8: 10
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - size: 2x2, position: (4,4), color: azure

    - size: 2x2, position: (6,3), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (1,4), color: blue
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,3), color: blue
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,3), color: blue

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

**transformation:**
  - The transformation in example 2 appears to be similar to example 1; however, it seems that there are additional azure pixels that are also converted to blue.  Specifically, it looks like the transformation might only apply to azure pixels adjacent to white pixels


**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation seems to involve changing some azure pixels to blue. The pattern isn't completely clear yet, however, the examples seem to suggest that  azure pixels adjacent to a white pixel change to blue.  More examples are needed to solidify the transformation rule and handle edge cases.  The size and position of the azure objects don't seem to directly influence the transformation.



# examples summary: 

Based on the two examples provided, the transformation rule appears to involve changing certain azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The rule isn't perfectly clear from just two examples, but a strong hypothesis is that an azure pixel changes to blue if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a white (0) pixel.

Let's summarize the observations and use code to analyze the patterns:

**Summary of Observations:**

* **Example 1:**  A single azure pixel in the top-right corner of each 2x2 azure block changes to blue.
* **Example 2:** Multiple azure pixels, specifically those adjacent to white pixels, change to blue.  This suggests adjacency to white is a key factor.

**Code Analysis to Confirm Adjacency Hypothesis:**

    for row, col in zip(*changed_pixels):
        if input_grid[row, col] == 8:  # Only check azure pixels
            adjacent_white = False
            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= new_row < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= new_col < input_grid.shape[1]:
                    if input_grid[new_row, new_col] == 0:
                        adjacent_white = True

```
Pixel at (1, 2): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (4, 4): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (1, 4): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (2, 3): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0
Pixel at (5, 3): Unexpected change.  Input value = 0

```

The code analysis reveals a flaw in the initial adjacency hypothesis.  The `Unexpected change` messages indicate that the transformation is not solely based on adjacency to white pixels.  The transformation is more complex than initially thought.  More examples are crucial to refine the rule.  The current examples are insufficient to determine a comprehensive and accurate transformation rule.
