Okay, I've initialized the working output grid from the input grid.  Now I need tools to modify it.  Please provide the `set_pixel` and `set_range` functions.  Also, clarify if there's a way to visualize the working grid after each pixel modification, as that would be very helpful.


Once I have these tools and visual feedback, I can start iteratively modifying the `working_output_grid` based on the observed patterns and refined hypotheses about the transformation.  I will continue to leverage code execution to analyze the grid and improve the accuracy of my rule-based approach.
