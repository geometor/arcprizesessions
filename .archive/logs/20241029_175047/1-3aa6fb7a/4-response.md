Here's an analysis of the test input, incorporating learnings from the previous examples:

**code_execution:**



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Count occurrences of each color
unique, counts = np.unique(test_input, return_counts=True)
color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
print(f"Color counts: {color_counts}")

# Identify Azure blocks
azure_indices = np.where(test_input == 8)
azure_coordinates = list(zip(azure_indices[0], azure_indices[1]))

# Function to find adjacent white pixels
def find_adjacent_white(grid, row, col):
    adjacent = False
    for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
        if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
            adjacent = True
            break
    return adjacent

# Analyze Azure pixels for adjacency to white pixels
adjacent_white_count = 0
for row, col in azure_coordinates:
    if find_adjacent_white(test_input, row, col):
        adjacent_white_count += 1

print(f"Number of Azure pixels adjacent to white: {adjacent_white_count}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Color counts: {np.int64(0): np.int64(37), np.int64(8): np.int64(12)}
Number of Azure pixels adjacent to white: 11

```

**Test Input:**

width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 37
  - 8: 12
objects:
  - size: 2x2, position: (0,5), color: azure
  - size: 2x2, position: (1,0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: azure
  - size: 2x2, position: (4,3), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (5,1), color: azure
  - size: 2x2, position: (6,0), color: azure

**Initial Hypothesis Refinement:**

The previous hypothesis, that only azure pixels adjacent to white pixels change, is incomplete. The additional examples suggest that the transformation is more complex and likely dependent on the location and arrangement of azure pixels within the grid. There may be multiple rules at play, or a single rule which considers context in a more nuanced way.  There are several distinct azure objects in the test input.


**Test Phase - Output Construction:**

To proceed with the test phase, I need a method to represent the output grid and tools to manipulate individual pixels.  Please provide these tools.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Provide the necessary functions and tools (like `initialize_output_from_input`, `set_pixel`, `set_range`, etc.) for constructing and modifying the output grid.
2.  Once equipped with those tools, I will systematically build the output grid based on my current refined hypothesis, which considers spatial relationships and context, along with the examples provided.  It is likely that some trial and error will be needed to understand the complete rules of transformation.
