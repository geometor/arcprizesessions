Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - a cluster of 8 (azure) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - same azure cluster as input.
  - two additional blue (1) pixels, one above and to the right of the cluster.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' (white) pixels changed to '1' (blue).  The positions of the new blue pixels seem related to the existing azure cluster.
```

**transformation:**
```
The transformation appears to add two blue pixels.  The location of these new pixels seems to be determined by the position of the azure cluster; specifically, it appears to add a blue pixel above and to the right of the topmost and rightmost azure pixels, respectively (if we imagine a bounding box around the azure cluster).  Further examples are needed to verify this hypothesis and to handle edge cases (if the cluster is at the edge of the grid).
```

To further investigate, I need more examples to confirm the pattern and handle edge cases.  The current hypothesis is that the addition of blue pixels depends on the bounding box of the azure cluster, but this needs to be verified.
