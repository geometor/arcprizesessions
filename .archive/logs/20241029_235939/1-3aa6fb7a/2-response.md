Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - a cluster of 8 (azure) pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 37
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - same azure cluster as input.
  - three additional blue (1) pixels, one above and to the right of the topmost and rightmost azure pixels, and another to the left of the bottommost azure pixel.
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '0' (white) pixels changed to '1' (blue).  The positions of the new blue pixels appear to be related to the bounding box of the azure cluster, similar to example_1.
```

**transformation:**
```
This example reinforces the hypothesis from example_1. It seems that for each extreme point (topmost, bottommost, leftmost, rightmost) of the azure cluster's bounding box, a blue pixel is added to the adjacent white pixel in that direction. However, this needs further verification with additional examples.  If the extreme point is on an edge of the grid, we would need to determine if a blue pixel is still added or not.
```

**Comparison with example_1:**

Both examples show the addition of blue pixels adjacent to the bounding box of the azure cluster. Example 1 shows a smaller cluster and only 2 added blue pixels, suggesting that we need to explore clusters of different sizes.

**Next Steps:**

To further refine the transformation rule, we need more examples to test these hypotheses:

1. **Clusters of different sizes and shapes:**  Test with various sizes and shapes of azure clusters to determine the consistency of the transformation.
2. **Clusters touching the edge:** Test with clusters that touch or are located near the edge of the grid to determine the behavior of the transformation near the boundaries.
3. **Multiple clusters:** Test with input grids containing multiple, separate clusters of azure pixels to clarify how the transformation handles this situation.


By examining additional examples, we can confirm or revise the current transformation hypothesis and handle edge cases.
