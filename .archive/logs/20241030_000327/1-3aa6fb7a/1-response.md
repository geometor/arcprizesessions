Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
*   **objects:** One cluster of 8's. The cluster is not rectangular or perfectly aligned, but it has a rough rectangular shape.

**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   **objects:** The cluster of 8's remains, with two additional pixels changed to 1 (blue). The new 1 pixels are diagonally adjacent to the existing 8's.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 2
*   **colors_changed:** Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue (1) pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels is diagonally adjacent to the existing group of azure (8) pixels.  Specifically it looks like it adds blue pixels diagonally adjacent to azure pixels that are at the edge of the cluster of azure pixels but not touching a white pixel. There is no obvious numerical or geometrical pattern beyond this observation.  More examples are needed to confirm if this observation is a rule.
