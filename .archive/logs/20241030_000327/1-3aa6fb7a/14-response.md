The submission has been made.  Given the limited number of examples, the result is likely to be incorrect.  The analysis showed that the rules for transforming the input grid into the output grid are too complex to be reliably inferred from only two examples.  The attempts to formulate rules based on adjacency to white and azure pixels were unsuccessful.  More examples are needed to develop a robust and accurate solution.  The submission of the unchanged input grid reflects the inability to determine a reliable transformation.
