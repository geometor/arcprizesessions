Given the lack of a clear rule and the failure of the hypothesis testing, I cannot reliably determine the output for the test input.  More examples are necessary to understand the pattern and develop a robust solution.  Without additional examples, any attempt to set pixels would be purely speculative and likely incorrect.  Therefore, I cannot proceed with `set_pixel` or `set_range` calls at this time.  The submission of the current working grid (which is identical to the input) is likely to result in an incorrect answer.
