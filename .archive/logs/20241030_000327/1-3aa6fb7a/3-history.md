## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
*   **objects:** One cluster of 8's. The cluster is not rectangular or perfectly aligned, but it has a rough rectangular shape.

**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   **objects:** The cluster of 8's remains, with two additional pixels changed to 1 (blue). The new 1 pixels are diagonally adjacent to the existing 8's.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 2
*   **colors_changed:** Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue (1) pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels is diagonally adjacent to the existing group of azure (8) pixels.  Specifically it looks like it adds blue pixels diagonally adjacent to azure pixels that are at the edge of the cluster of azure pixels but not touching a white pixel. There is no obvious numerical or geometrical pattern beyond this observation.  More examples are needed to confirm if this observation is a rule.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (8)
*   **objects:** A more dispersed cluster of 8's compared to example 1.  The cluster is not rectangular or perfectly aligned but forms a rough 'L' shape.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   **objects:** The cluster of 8's remains, with three additional pixels changed to 1 (blue).


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 3
*   **colors_changed:** Three pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

Similar to example 1, this example adds blue (1) pixels. Again, the added blue pixels are diagonally adjacent to the existing azure (8) pixels.  The pattern appears to be adding blue pixels adjacent to an azure pixel that doesn't touch a white pixel. The number of added blue pixels seems to depend on the number of such eligible azure pixels (i.e., those not directly adjacent to white pixels).

**Comparison with Example 1:**

Both examples show the addition of blue pixels diagonally adjacent to azure pixels on the border of the azure cluster. The number of blue pixels added seems to correlate with the number of "eligible" azure pixels at the edge of their clusters.  There may be a rule that counts how many azure pixels on the edge of the cluster are not touching white pixels, and then that number determines how many blue pixels are added.  The specific rule or algorithm, however, is still not fully discernible.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves iterating through each azure pixel, checking if it's adjacent to white pixels. If not, add a blue pixel diagonally adjacent to the current azure pixel, provided the diagonally adjacent location is white.  This hypothesis could also consider some sort of ordering/priority (e.g., top-down, left-right) in the iteration process, but further examples would be helpful to verify this.
