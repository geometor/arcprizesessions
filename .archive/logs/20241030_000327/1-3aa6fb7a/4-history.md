## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
*   **objects:** One cluster of 8's. The cluster is not rectangular or perfectly aligned, but it has a rough rectangular shape.

**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   **objects:** The cluster of 8's remains, with two additional pixels changed to 1 (blue). The new 1 pixels are diagonally adjacent to the existing 8's.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 2
*   **colors_changed:** Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue (1) pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels is diagonally adjacent to the existing group of azure (8) pixels.  Specifically it looks like it adds blue pixels diagonally adjacent to azure pixels that are at the edge of the cluster of azure pixels but not touching a white pixel. There is no obvious numerical or geometrical pattern beyond this observation.  More examples are needed to confirm if this observation is a rule.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (8)
*   **objects:** A more dispersed cluster of 8's compared to example 1.  The cluster is not rectangular or perfectly aligned but forms a rough 'L' shape.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   **objects:** The cluster of 8's remains, with three additional pixels changed to 1 (blue).


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 3
*   **colors_changed:** Three pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

Similar to example 1, this example adds blue (1) pixels. Again, the added blue pixels are diagonally adjacent to the existing azure (8) pixels.  The pattern appears to be adding blue pixels adjacent to an azure pixel that doesn't touch a white pixel. The number of added blue pixels seems to depend on the number of such eligible azure pixels (i.e., those not directly adjacent to white pixels).

**Comparison with Example 1:**

Both examples show the addition of blue pixels diagonally adjacent to azure pixels on the border of the azure cluster. The number of blue pixels added seems to correlate with the number of "eligible" azure pixels at the edge of their clusters.  There may be a rule that counts how many azure pixels on the edge of the cluster are not touching white pixels, and then that number determines how many blue pixels are added.  The specific rule or algorithm, however, is still not fully discernible.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves iterating through each azure pixel, checking if it's adjacent to white pixels. If not, add a blue pixel diagonally adjacent to the current azure pixel, provided the diagonally adjacent location is white.  This hypothesis could also consider some sort of ordering/priority (e.g., top-down, left-right) in the iteration process, but further examples would be helpful to verify this.


# examples summary: 

The transformation rule appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels diagonally adjacent to azure (8) pixels that are on the edge of a cluster of azure pixels and are not adjacent to white (0) pixels.  Let's call these "eligible" azure pixels. The number of blue pixels added seems to equal the number of eligible azure pixels.

To verify this hypothesis, let's analyze the examples using Python.  We will represent the grids as NumPy arrays:

The `count_eligible_azure` function is incorrect. It's identifying 0 eligible pixels in both examples.  The problem is that it's incorrectly determining eligibility. An azure pixel is eligible if it is not adjacent to a white pixel, but the current function checks if it *is* adjacent to a white pixel, and if so, sets `is_eligible` to `False`.  Let's correct this function:

The corrected `count_eligible_azure` function still yields 0 eligible azure pixels. This indicates that my initial hypothesis is incorrect.  The rule is not simply adding blue pixels diagonally to eligible azure pixels. There must be another factor determining the placement and number of blue pixels added.


Let's revisit the examples visually.  It seems the blue pixels are added to locations which are *diagonally adjacent to at least one azure pixel and not adjacent to any white pixel*.  The number of blue pixels added might still be related to the number of azure pixels, but not necessarily the number of directly eligible azure pixels as previously defined.


I need more examples to refine the rule further. The current examples don't provide enough information to confidently determine the exact transformation rule.
