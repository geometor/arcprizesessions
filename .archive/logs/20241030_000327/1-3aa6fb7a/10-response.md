The analysis has shown that the transformation rules are more complex than initially assumed, and that the available data (two examples) is insufficient to reliably determine the pattern.  The code attempts to identify potential locations for blue pixels based on adjacency to azure pixels and the number of adjacent white pixels, but these attempts have been unsuccessful in replicating the observed transformations.

The current working output grid remains unchanged from the input grid because adding blue pixels based on any currently formulated rule is too speculative and likely to be incorrect. More examples are crucial to uncover the underlying logic governing the placement of the blue pixels.  Until a more robust rule or a machine learning approach (requiring more data) can be implemented, further modifications to the grid would be unreliable and counterproductive.
