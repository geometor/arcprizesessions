The analysis so far indicates that the transformation rules are complex and not easily expressible with simple rules.  The attempts to define rules based on adjacency to white pixels and azure pixels have been unsuccessful.

The current working output grid remains unchanged from the input because any modification without a well-defined rule would be speculative and likely incorrect.  More examples are absolutely crucial to solving this puzzle.  The limited dataset prevents the development of a reliable and accurate algorithm.  Without more information, the current working output grid (which is identical to the input grid) will be submitted.  This will likely be incorrect, but it is the best action given the lack of a sufficiently defined transformation rule.
