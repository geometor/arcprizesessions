The transformation rule appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels diagonally adjacent to azure (8) pixels that are on the edge of a cluster of azure pixels and are not adjacent to white (0) pixels.  Let's call these "eligible" azure pixels. The number of blue pixels added seems to equal the number of eligible azure pixels.

To verify this hypothesis, let's analyze the examples using Python.  We will represent the grids as NumPy arrays:

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

The `count_eligible_azure` function is incorrect. It's identifying 0 eligible pixels in both examples.  The problem is that it's incorrectly determining eligibility. An azure pixel is eligible if it is not adjacent to a white pixel, but the current function checks if it *is* adjacent to a white pixel, and if so, sets `is_eligible` to `False`.  Let's correct this function:

```

```

The corrected `count_eligible_azure` function still yields 0 eligible azure pixels. This indicates that my initial hypothesis is incorrect.  The rule is not simply adding blue pixels diagonally to eligible azure pixels. There must be another factor determining the placement and number of blue pixels added.


Let's revisit the examples visually.  It seems the blue pixels are added to locations which are *diagonally adjacent to at least one azure pixel and not adjacent to any white pixel*.  The number of blue pixels added might still be related to the number of azure pixels, but not necessarily the number of directly eligible azure pixels as previously defined.


I need more examples to refine the rule further. The current examples don't provide enough information to confidently determine the exact transformation rule.
