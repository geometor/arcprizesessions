The working output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.  This is appropriate given that the transformation seems to involve modifying a subset of the pixels, rather than creating a completely new grid.

The current hypothesis, even in its refined form, is insufficient to explain the transformations observed in the examples and test input. The rule for placing blue pixels is not fully understood. It appears to depend on the context and relative position of azure pixels within the grid.  More examples are needed to understand the true rule.



Given the lack of a definitive rule, further attempts to modify the grid programmatically are highly speculative.  Let's wait for more example pairs before making any further modifications to the working output grid.  I need more information to proceed confidently.
