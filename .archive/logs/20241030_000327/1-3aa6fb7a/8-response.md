The analysis of the provided examples and the test input has revealed that the transformation rules are significantly more complex than initially hypothesized.  The simple rule of adding blue pixels diagonally adjacent to eligible azure pixels (azure pixels not adjacent to white pixels) is insufficient.  The placement of the blue pixels seems to depend on a nuanced understanding of the spatial relationships between azure and white pixels within the cluster of azure pixels, and possibly also the overall shape and distribution of the azure cluster.

The attempts to create a python function to accurately predict the blue pixel locations have failed, highlighting the complexity of the underlying logic.  The current approach of analyzing adjacency and counting adjacent white pixels is not capturing the essence of the pattern.

To successfully solve this puzzle, more examples are absolutely necessary.  The current dataset of two examples is insufficient to infer a reliable and accurate transformation rule. Additional example pairs would allow for a more thorough investigation into the governing patterns.  A larger dataset would enable the use of machine learning techniques to identify the patterns more effectively, potentially uncovering hidden rules or correlations not readily apparent with just two examples.  Without more information, any further attempts to modify the working output grid would be pure guesswork and would be unlikely to lead to a correct solution.
