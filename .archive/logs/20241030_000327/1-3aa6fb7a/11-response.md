I cannot proceed without more examples.  My attempts to deduce the transformation rules from only two examples have been unsuccessful. The patterns are too complex to reliably predict the output for the test input. Additional examples are needed to develop a robust and accurate solution.  Any attempt to use `set_pixel` or `set_range` at this point would be purely speculative and likely incorrect.
