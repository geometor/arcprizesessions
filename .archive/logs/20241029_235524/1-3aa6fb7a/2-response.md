Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels arranged in an irregular 'L' shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels, similar to the input.
    *   Three blue pixels.

**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   Similar to example 1, this example also adds blue pixels (1) adjacent to azure pixels (8).  However, the pattern is less clear. The locations aren't strictly diagonal. It seems that blue pixels are added adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to azure pixels, potentially following some kind of proximity or connectivity rule.  To determine the exact rule, more examples are needed. It may depend on shape or position of the cluster of 8's or possibly the number of 8's.  The locations of the new blue pixels appear to follow the adjacency of existing 8 pixels but don't appear to have a consistent pattern relative to the shape of the larger cluster.  More examples are needed to better understand the pattern.


**Combined Observations from examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show the addition of blue (1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels seems to be related to the proximity to existing azure pixels, but the precise rule governing placement requires more examples to be determined. It's possible the rule is more complex than a simple diagonal or adjacent rule. The size and shape of the azure cluster might influence the number and placement of new blue pixels.  There doesn't seem to be a predictable number of blue pixels added relative to the number of azure pixels present.  More examples are needed for accurate rule extraction.
