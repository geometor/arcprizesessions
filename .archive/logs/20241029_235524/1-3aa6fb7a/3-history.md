## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels arranged in an irregular shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels similar to input.
    *   Two blue pixels.  One is adjacent and to the right of an azure pixel near the top. The second is below and to the left of an azure pixel in the lower right quadrant.

**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to involve the addition of two blue pixels. The positions of the added blue pixels are related to the existing cluster of azure pixels. They are diagonally adjacent to existing azure pixels.  A more precise rule needs further examples to confirm.  A hypothesis is that the transformation adds blue pixels in the "top-right" and "bottom-left" locations that are diagonally adjacent to azure pixels.  Additional examples will determine if this is accurate or if the rule is more complex.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels arranged in an irregular 'L' shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels, similar to the input.
    *   Three blue pixels.

**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   Similar to example 1, this example also adds blue pixels (1) adjacent to azure pixels (8).  However, the pattern is less clear. The locations aren't strictly diagonal. It seems that blue pixels are added adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to azure pixels, potentially following some kind of proximity or connectivity rule.  To determine the exact rule, more examples are needed. It may depend on shape or position of the cluster of 8's or possibly the number of 8's.  The locations of the new blue pixels appear to follow the adjacency of existing 8 pixels but don't appear to have a consistent pattern relative to the shape of the larger cluster.  More examples are needed to better understand the pattern.


**Combined Observations from examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show the addition of blue (1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels seems to be related to the proximity to existing azure pixels, but the precise rule governing placement requires more examples to be determined. It's possible the rule is more complex than a simple diagonal or adjacent rule. The size and shape of the azure cluster might influence the number and placement of new blue pixels.  There doesn't seem to be a predictable number of blue pixels added relative to the number of azure pixels present.  More examples are needed for accurate rule extraction.
