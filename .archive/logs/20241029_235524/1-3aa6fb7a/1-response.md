Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels arranged in an irregular shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels similar to input.
    *   Two blue pixels.  One is adjacent and to the right of an azure pixel near the top. The second is below and to the left of an azure pixel in the lower right quadrant.

**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to involve the addition of two blue pixels. The positions of the added blue pixels are related to the existing cluster of azure pixels. They are diagonally adjacent to existing azure pixels.  A more precise rule needs further examples to confirm.  A hypothesis is that the transformation adds blue pixels in the "top-right" and "bottom-left" locations that are diagonally adjacent to azure pixels.  Additional examples will determine if this is accurate or if the rule is more complex.
