Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (42) white
    *   8: (6) light blue
*   **objects:** One cluster of light blue pixels.  The cluster is not geometrically regular (it's somewhat L-shaped).


**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41) white
    *   8: (5) light blue
    *   1: (2) blue
*   **objects:** The cluster is largely unchanged, however two light blue pixels have been changed to blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 2
*   **colors_changed:** Two light blue pixels changed to blue.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some of the light blue pixels to blue pixels.  The location of the change isn't immediately obvious from this single example; more examples are needed to determine a rule to locate the pixels to change.  It could be based on proximity to other pixels, location relative to the edges, or other factors.  A hypothesis is that the two bottom-most cells containing 8 are replaced by 1.


**Next Steps:**  I need more examples to confirm the transformation rule and determine whether there are additional or more complex transformation rules at play.
