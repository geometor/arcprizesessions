The working output grid has been initialized correctly from the input grid.  The next step is to apply the transformation rule using the `transform_grid` function.  Let's do that and review the results.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for col in range(cols):
        col_data = grid[:, col]
        if np.any(col_data == 8):
            col_indices = np.where(col_data == 8)[0]
            lowest_eight_index = np.max(col_indices)
            grid[lowest_eight_index, col] = 1
    return grid

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

transformed_grid = transform_grid(working_grid)
print("Transformed Grid:\n", transformed_grid)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Transformed Grid:
 [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The transformed grid matches the prediction made earlier. The lowest 8 in each column containing at least one 8 has been changed to 1.  This is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples.


The transformed grid is ready for submission.  I believe this is the correct solution based on the analysis of the examples and the application of the transformation rule.
