## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (42) white
    *   8: (6) light blue
*   **objects:** One cluster of light blue pixels.  The cluster is not geometrically regular (it's somewhat L-shaped).


**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (41) white
    *   8: (5) light blue
    *   1: (2) blue
*   **objects:** The cluster is largely unchanged, however two light blue pixels have been changed to blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 2
*   **colors_changed:** Two light blue pixels changed to blue.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some of the light blue pixels to blue pixels.  The location of the change isn't immediately obvious from this single example; more examples are needed to determine a rule to locate the pixels to change.  It could be based on proximity to other pixels, location relative to the edges, or other factors.  A hypothesis is that the two bottom-most cells containing 8 are replaced by 1.


**Next Steps:**  I need more examples to confirm the transformation rule and determine whether there are additional or more complex transformation rules at play.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building on the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (37) white
    *   8: (10) light blue
*   **objects:** A cluster of light blue pixels.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 7
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (36) white
    *   8: (9) light blue
    *   1: (3) blue
*   **objects:**  The cluster of light blue pixels is largely unchanged, with three light blue pixels changed to blue.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 3
*   **colors_changed:** Three light blue (8) pixels changed to blue (1).


**Transformation:**

Example 2 reinforces the hypothesis from example 1. The transformation appears to consistently replace certain light blue pixels with blue pixels. The pattern seems to target the bottom-most light blue pixels in each vertical column that contains light blue pixels.

**Combining Examples 1 & 2:**

The transformation rule seems to be:  Identify all columns containing at least one light blue pixel (8). In each of those columns, change the bottom-most light blue pixel to blue (1).

**Next Steps:**

The hypothesis is fairly well-supported by these two examples.  Further examples are still useful to confirm this rule and to check for edge cases or exceptions.  Testing the hypothesis requires applying it to the test input.
