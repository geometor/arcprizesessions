Here's an analysis of the test input, followed by a refined approach to the transformation:

**Test Input Analysis:**



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

unique_vals, counts = np.unique(test_input, return_counts=True)
print(f"Unique values and counts:\n{dict(zip(unique_vals, counts))}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Unique values and counts:
{np.int64(0): np.int64(37), np.int64(8): np.int64(12)}

```

The test input has 7x7 = 49 cells.  37 are white (0), and 12 are azure (8). There are several 2x2 blocks of azure pixels, and some single azure pixels.  Many are at the edges.  The transformation will require careful handling of these edge cases to avoid index errors or adding blue pixels outside the grid.

**Refined Transformation Algorithm:**

The previous attempts failed to consistently and correctly handle all instances of adjacent azure pixels.  To mitigate this, we can implement a more robust approach:

1. **Iterate over the grid:** We iterate through the grid, but this time, instead of checking for 2x2 blocks directly, we check only if a pixel is azure (value 8).

2. **Check neighbors:** If we find an azure pixel, we check its right and bottom neighbors (within the grid bounds). If either is white (0), we add a blue (1) to it.

3. **Avoid Overwriting:** We use a boolean array to track already-processed cells to prevent adding blue pixels multiple times to the same cell.

This approach is more efficient and less prone to errors from overlapping 2x2 blocks:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def apply_transformation(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    processed = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)  # Track processed cells

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not processed[r, c]:
                processed[r, c] = True  # Mark current cell as processed
                if r + 1 < rows and new_grid[r + 1, c] == 0:
                    new_grid[r + 1, c] = 1
                if c + 1 < cols and new_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                    new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1

    return new_grid

# Test input:
test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

test_output = apply_transformation(test_input)
print(f"Test Output:\n{test_output}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Test Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]

```

The code above now generates the solution for the test input grid.  The `processed` array is key to preventing redundant additions of blue pixels and to obtaining the correct solution.  This revised algorithm more accurately reflects the observed transformation rule.  The output array `test_output` represents the solution to the puzzle.
