Because the examples show relatively few differences between input and output, and the changes are localized, initializing the output grid from the input grid is the most appropriate strategy.  This will provide a good starting point and minimize unnecessary computation.

code_execution:


function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:

initialize_output_from_input()
