The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to existing azure (8) pixels.  Specifically, for each 2x2 block of azure pixels, a single blue pixel is added to the right and below the block. If the block is on the edge of the grid, a blue pixel is only added where space allows.  The placement of the added blue pixels ensures that no blue pixel is added to a location where another blue pixel already exists. The challenge lies in accurately identifying and handling these 2x2 blocks without overlapping or missing any and in correctly placing the new pixels.  The previous attempts at coding this transformation have failed to meet this precision.  Further refinement of the algorithm is necessary to account for edge cases and overlapping blocks to prevent duplicate additions of blue pixels.
