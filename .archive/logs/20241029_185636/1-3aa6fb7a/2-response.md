Based on the two examples provided, the transformation rule appears to be:

**For each 2x2 block of azure (8) pixels, add a single blue (1) pixel to the right and below.**  If the azure block is on an edge, the blue pixel is added only where possible (i.e., not beyond the grid boundary).

Let's verify this with code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def apply_transformation(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            if (grid[r, c] == 8 and grid[r + 1, c] == 8 and
                    grid[r, c + 1] == 8 and grid[r + 1, c + 1] == 8):
                if c + 1 < cols:
                    new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1
                if r + 1 < rows:
                    new_grid[r + 1, c] = 1
    return new_grid

# Example 1
input_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_grid_1 = apply_transformation(input_grid_1)
print("Example 1 Output:\n", output_grid_1)

# Example 2
input_grid_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])
output_grid_2 = apply_transformation(input_grid_2)
print("Example 2 Output:\n", output_grid_2)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```

 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

```

The code's output for Example 1 is incorrect.  It does not add the blue pixels. The issue is in the condition checking for 2x2 azure blocks. It needs to handle edge cases and properly identify 2x2 blocks regardless of their position in the grid.  I need to revise the `apply_transformation` function.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def apply_transformation(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            block = grid[r:r+2, c:c+2]
            if np.all(block == 8):
                if c + 2 <= cols:
                    new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1
                if r + 2 <= rows:
                    new_grid[r + 1, c] = 1
    return new_grid

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_grid_1 = apply_transformation(input_grid_1)
print("Example 1 Output:\n", output_grid_1)

The corrected code still produces incorrect outputs. There's a fundamental flaw in how the 2x2 blocks are identified and the blue pixels added. The current approach doesn't reliably detect all 2x2 blocks of '8's and places the '1's correctly. Let's try a different strategy:




code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def apply_transformation(grid):
  new_grid = np.copy(grid)
  rows, cols = grid.shape
  for r in range(rows):
    for c in range(cols):
      if grid[r, c] == 8:
        if r > 0 and c > 0 and grid[r-1,c-1] == 8 and grid[r-1,c] == 8 and grid[r,c-1] == 8:
          continue #already handled
        if r > 0 and c < cols -1 and grid[r-1,c] == 8 and grid[r-1,c+1] == 8 and grid[r,c+1] == 8:
          continue #already handled
        if r < rows - 1 and c > 0 and grid[r,c-1] == 8 and grid[r+1,c-1] == 8 and grid[r+1,c] == 8:
          continue #already handled
        if r < rows - 1 and c < cols -1 and grid[r,c+1] == 8 and grid[r+1,c] == 8 and grid[r+1,c+1] == 8:
          continue #already handled

        if r + 1 < rows and new_grid[r+1, c] == 0:
          new_grid[r+1, c] = 1
        if c + 1 < cols and new_grid[r, c+1] == 0:
          new_grid[r, c+1] = 1

  return new_grid

# Example 1
input_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
output_grid_1 = apply_transformation(input_grid_1)
print("Example 1 Output:\n", output_grid_1)

# Example 2
input_grid_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

output_grid_2 = apply_transformation(input_grid_2)
print("Example 2 Output:\n", output_grid_2)

The new code is closer to the intended solution but still has issues.  It's adding more blue pixels than expected in certain configurations. The logic needs further refinement to precisely identify and handle overlapping 2x2 blocks.  The current method is overcounting and adding extra blue pixels, especially where multiple 2x2 blocks touch. A more sophisticated approach might involve tracking already-processed pixels or using a different iteration strategy (e.g., checking for blocks in a specific order to avoid double-counting).  We will need to further analyze and refine the logic. I am not yet confident in the current function.
