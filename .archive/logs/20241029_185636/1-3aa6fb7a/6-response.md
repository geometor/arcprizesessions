The working output grid is correctly initialized from the input grid.  The next step is to apply the transformation using the `apply_transformation` function.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def apply_transformation(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    processed = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)  # Track processed cells

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not processed[r, c]:
                processed[r, c] = True  # Mark current cell as processed
                if r + 1 < rows and new_grid[r + 1, c] == 0:
                    new_grid[r + 1, c] = 1
                if c + 1 < cols and new_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                    new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1

    return new_grid

# Test input:
test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

test_output = apply_transformation(test_input)
print(f"Test Output:\n{test_output}")

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Test Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]

```
The `apply_transformation` function has been applied to the working output grid. The resulting grid is `test_output`. This represents the final solution.  I am confident that this solution accurately reflects the transformation rules observed in the examples.  Therefore, I submit this solution.

## Submit
The final output grid is:

[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 1 1 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
