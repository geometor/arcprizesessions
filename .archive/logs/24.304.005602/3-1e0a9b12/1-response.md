Here's an analysis of example_1:

```
input:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 11
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (0,1), (2,1)
    - magenta (6): (2,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - maroon (9): (0,3)

output:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 12
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (2,1), (3,1)
    - magenta (6): (3,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - maroon (9): (3,3)

differences:
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  The non-zero values in the input grid seem to be collected into the bottom-right corner of the output grid, while the rest of the pixels become white.  The relative positions of the non-zero colored cells remain mostly consistent but are shifted down and right.


transformation:
  - The transformation appears to be a consolidation of the non-zero colored pixels to the bottom right corner of the grid, while other pixels change to 0 (white). The relative positions of the colored pixels are somewhat preserved in the consolidation.  The transformation is not simply moving or copying; it's collecting and repackaging.
```

My initial hypothesis is that the transformation involves collecting all non-white pixels and placing them in the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions to each other as much as possible.  The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.  I'll need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.
