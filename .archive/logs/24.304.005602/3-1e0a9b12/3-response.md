differences:
  cells_changed: 9
  colors_changed: Non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right, similar to previous examples.  Relative positions are mostly maintained, but there's a shift.

transformation:
  - The transformation continues the pattern of consolidating non-white pixels towards the bottom-right corner, preserving relative positions as much as possible.  The transformation is more of a collection and repackaging rather than direct movement.
```

The pattern observed across all three examples strongly suggests a transformation that moves all non-white pixels to the bottom-right corner of the grid, while maintaining their relative positions as much as possible.  The algorithm appears to prioritize filling the bottom-right corner row-wise from left to right and then column-wise from top to bottom. There may be slight variations in the exact placement to accommodate the available space.  The remaining cells are filled with white.  This behavior is consistent and predictable, forming the basis for solving subsequent puzzles in this series.
