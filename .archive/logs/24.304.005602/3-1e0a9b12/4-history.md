## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

```
input:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 11
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (0,1), (2,1)
    - magenta (6): (2,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - maroon (9): (0,3)

output:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 12
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (2,1), (3,1)
    - magenta (6): (3,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - maroon (9): (3,3)

differences:
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  The non-zero values in the input grid seem to be collected into the bottom-right corner of the output grid, while the rest of the pixels become white.  The relative positions of the non-zero colored cells remain mostly consistent but are shifted down and right.


transformation:
  - The transformation appears to be a consolidation of the non-zero colored pixels to the bottom right corner of the grid, while other pixels change to 0 (white). The relative positions of the colored pixels are somewhat preserved in the consolidation.  The transformation is not simply moving or copying; it's collecting and repackaging.
```

My initial hypothesis is that the transformation involves collecting all non-white pixels and placing them in the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions to each other as much as possible.  The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.  I'll need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.

## observations:

```
input:
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 28
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)
    - azure (8): (1,3), (4,3)
    - maroon (9): (0,5)

output:
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 33
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,4), (5,4)
    - azure (8): (4,4), (5,4)
    - maroon (9): (5,5)

differences:
  cells_changed: 6
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved towards the bottom right, similar to example_1.  The relative positions of those pixels are preserved but some shifted.

transformation:
  - Similar to example 1, the transformation involves consolidating non-zero colored pixels towards the bottom right corner, maintaining relative positions as much as possible. However, there is some variation or ambiguity in maintaining these positions.  Some objects are stacked vertically.
```

The transformation seems to be a process of moving non-white pixels to the bottom right while maintaining their relative positions as much as possible.  The exact placement within the bottom-right quadrant seems flexible, and the overall shape isn't strictly preserved. The algorithm appears to prioritize filling the bottom-right corner first, with vertical stacking where needed.


Based on the two examples, my refined hypothesis is that the transformation aims to collect all non-white pixels and place them in the bottom-right corner of the output grid, preserving their relative positions as much as possible while allowing some flexibility, particularly vertical stacking, to accommodate the available space.  The remaining pixels in the output grid are filled with white.  This isn't a simple translation but more of a consolidation and repackaging into the bottom right corner.

## observations:

input:
  width: 5

  colors:
    - 0: 18
    - 1: 2

    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (0,3), (2,3)
    - red (2): (2,4)
    - green (3): (1,1), (2,1), (4,1)
    - magenta (6): (3,0)

output:
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 21
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (3,3), (4,3)
    - red (2): (4,4)
    - green (3): (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)
    - magenta (6): (4,0)

differences:
  cells_changed: 9
  colors_changed: Non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right, similar to previous examples.  Relative positions are mostly maintained, but there's a shift.

transformation:
  - The transformation continues the pattern of consolidating non-white pixels towards the bottom-right corner, preserving relative positions as much as possible.  The transformation is more of a collection and repackaging rather than direct movement.
```

The pattern observed across all three examples strongly suggests a transformation that moves all non-white pixels to the bottom-right corner of the grid, while maintaining their relative positions as much as possible.  The algorithm appears to prioritize filling the bottom-right corner row-wise from left to right and then column-wise from top to bottom. There may be slight variations in the exact placement to accommodate the available space.  The remaining cells are filled with white.  This behavior is consistent and predictable, forming the basis for solving subsequent puzzles in this series.
