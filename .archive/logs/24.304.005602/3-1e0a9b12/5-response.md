differences:
  cells_changed: 11
  colors_changed:  All non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right corner.

transformation:
  - The transformation follows the established pattern: consolidation of non-zero colored pixels into the bottom-right corner, maintaining relative positions as much as possible.  There will likely be some vertical stacking to accommodate all the pixels.

import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
  """Analyzes a grid to count colors and find non-zero coordinates."""
  grid_np = np.array(grid)
  colors = {}
  non_zero_coords = []
  for i in range(grid_np.shape[0]):
    for j in range(grid_np.shape[1]):
      val = grid_np[i, j]

      if val != 0:
        non_zero_coords.append((i, j))

```

Based on the analysis of the previous examples and the code execution results, the following steps are proposed to generate the output grid:

1. **Initialize the output grid:** Create a 5x5 grid filled with zeros (white).

2. **Place the non-zero pixels:**  Iterate through the `input_coords`. For each coordinate, get the color value from the input grid.  Place that color value at a corresponding location in the output grid, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving left and then up. The exact positioning might require some minor adjustments to maintain relative positions as much as possible.


**Predicted Output Grid (based on the transformation observed in previous examples):**

```
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [5 2 6 4 3]
 [5 5 0 2 0]]
```

This placement prioritizes filling the bottom row from right to left, then the second-to-bottom row, and so on, maintaining the relative position of the objects as much as possible.  The remaining cells are filled with white.
