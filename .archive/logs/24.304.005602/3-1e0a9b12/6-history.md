## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

```
input:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 11
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (0,1), (2,1)
    - magenta (6): (2,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - maroon (9): (0,3)

output:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 12
    - 1: 1
    - 4: 2
    - 6: 1
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (2,1), (3,1)
    - magenta (6): (3,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - maroon (9): (3,3)

differences:
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  The non-zero values in the input grid seem to be collected into the bottom-right corner of the output grid, while the rest of the pixels become white.  The relative positions of the non-zero colored cells remain mostly consistent but are shifted down and right.


transformation:
  - The transformation appears to be a consolidation of the non-zero colored pixels to the bottom right corner of the grid, while other pixels change to 0 (white). The relative positions of the colored pixels are somewhat preserved in the consolidation.  The transformation is not simply moving or copying; it's collecting and repackaging.
```

My initial hypothesis is that the transformation involves collecting all non-white pixels and placing them in the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions to each other as much as possible.  The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels.  I'll need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.

    - orange (7): (4,4), (5,4)
    - azure (8): (4,4), (5,4)
    - maroon (9): (5,5)

differences:
  cells_changed: 6
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved towards the bottom right, similar to example_1.  The relative positions of those pixels are preserved but some shifted.

transformation:
  - Similar to example 1, the transformation involves consolidating non-zero colored pixels towards the bottom right corner, maintaining relative positions as much as possible. However, there is some variation or ambiguity in maintaining these positions.  Some objects are stacked vertically.
```

The transformation seems to be a process of moving non-white pixels to the bottom right while maintaining their relative positions as much as possible.  The exact placement within the bottom-right quadrant seems flexible, and the overall shape isn't strictly preserved. The algorithm appears to prioritize filling the bottom-right corner first, with vertical stacking where needed.


Based on the two examples, my refined hypothesis is that the transformation aims to collect all non-white pixels and place them in the bottom-right corner of the output grid, preserving their relative positions as much as possible while allowing some flexibility, particularly vertical stacking, to accommodate the available space.  The remaining pixels in the output grid are filled with white.  This isn't a simple translation but more of a consolidation and repackaging into the bottom right corner.

    - red (2): (4,4)
    - green (3): (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)
    - magenta (6): (4,0)

differences:
  cells_changed: 9
  colors_changed: Non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right, similar to previous examples.  Relative positions are mostly maintained, but there's a shift.

transformation:
  - The transformation continues the pattern of consolidating non-white pixels towards the bottom-right corner, preserving relative positions as much as possible.  The transformation is more of a collection and repackaging rather than direct movement.
```

The pattern observed across all three examples strongly suggests a transformation that moves all non-white pixels to the bottom-right corner of the grid, while maintaining their relative positions as much as possible.  The algorithm appears to prioritize filling the bottom-right corner row-wise from left to right and then column-wise from top to bottom. There may be slight variations in the exact placement to accommodate the available space.  The remaining cells are filled with white.  This behavior is consistent and predictable, forming the basis for solving subsequent puzzles in this series.


# examples summary: 

The transformation consistently moves all non-white pixels from the input grid to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.  The relative positions of these pixels are preserved as much as possible, though there's some flexibility, particularly with vertical stacking, to fit them into the available space.  The algorithm prioritizes filling the bottom-right corner row-wise from left to right, then column-wise from top to bottom. Any remaining cells in the output grid are filled with white (0).  This behavior is consistent across all three examples.

Let's use code to analyze the numerical patterns and confirm the observations:

```

The code confirms the observation that the number of each color remains consistent between input and output. The coordinates of the non-zero pixels change, but the code does not yet reveal a simple mathematical pattern to describe their transformation from input to output coordinates.  The visual observation of a bottom-right consolidation remains the most reliable description of the transformation.  The relative positions are mostly preserved but not perfectly.  There is flexibility in the exact positioning within the bottom-right quadrant.

```

Based on the analysis of the previous examples and the code execution results, the following steps are proposed to generate the output grid:

1. **Initialize the output grid:** Create a 5x5 grid filled with zeros (white).

2. **Place the non-zero pixels:**  Iterate through the `input_coords`. For each coordinate, get the color value from the input grid.  Place that color value at a corresponding location in the output grid, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving left and then up. The exact positioning might require some minor adjustments to maintain relative positions as much as possible.


**Predicted Output Grid (based on the transformation observed in previous examples):**

```
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [5 2 6 4 3]
 [5 5 0 2 0]]
```

This placement prioritizes filling the bottom row from right to left, then the second-to-bottom row, and so on, maintaining the relative position of the objects as much as possible.  The remaining cells are filled with white.




## initialize the working output grid

use function_call to initialize the working output grid:

- initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output

- initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
