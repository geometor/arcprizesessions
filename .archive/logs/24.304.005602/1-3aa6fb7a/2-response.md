Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42) white
    *   8: (8) azure
*   objects: A cluster of azure pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40) white
    *   1: (3) blue
    *   8: (8) azure
*   objects: Similar to the input, but with three additional blue pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.  Again, there's no immediately apparent pattern in the location of the changes beyond a possible, but weak, tendency for the change to occur adjacent to a larger cluster of azure pixels.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example_1: some azure pixels are changed to blue.  However,  we still lack a clear rule to predict which azure pixels will change. The number of changes varies. The spatial distribution of changes appears random at this point.

**Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show the transformation of a subset of azure pixels to blue pixels. The number of changes is not consistent, and their location seems arbitrary. The transformation does not appear geometric or rule-based (e.g., changing pixels on edges or corners).  Additional examples are crucial to identify a reliable pattern.  More examples might reveal a hidden rule that is not apparent after just two cases.  It may be a stochastic process with some underlying probability.
