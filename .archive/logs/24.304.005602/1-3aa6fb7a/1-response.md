Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42) white
    *   8: (6) azure
*   objects: One main cluster of azure pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40) white
    *   1: (2) blue
    *   8: (6) azure
*   objects: Similar to the input, but with two additional blue pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.  The locations of these changed pixels seem arbitrary and lack an obvious pattern based on adjacency or proximity to other pixels.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. The rule for *which* azure pixels change is unclear from this single example.  More examples are needed to determine if there is a consistent pattern or rule governing this change.  The location of the changed pixels don't appear related to edges, corners, or the center.  The addition of blue pixels seems random.
