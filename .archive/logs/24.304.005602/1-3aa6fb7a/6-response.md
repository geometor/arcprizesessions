The working output grid is initialized correctly from the input grid.  Let's use code to verify the count of azure pixels and then propose locations for adding blue pixels based on our refined hypothesis from the previous examples.  As before, we'll aim for a distribution that's consistent with the training examples, placing blue pixels in empty spaces near existing azure clusters.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

azure_count = np.count_nonzero(working_output == 8)
print(f"Number of azure pixels: {azure_count}")

#Hypothesis: approximately 1 blue pixel added per 3 azure pixels.
predicted_blue_pixels = int(azure_count / 3)  #integer division to get whole number
print(f"Predicted number of blue pixels to add: {predicted_blue_pixels}")

#Proposed locations for blue pixels (adjust as needed based on visual inspection)
proposed_blue_locations = [(0,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,6)]


updated_output = np.copy(working_output)
for row, col in proposed_blue_locations:
    updated_output[row, col] = 1

print(updated_output)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Number of azure pixels: 12
Predicted number of blue pixels to add: 4
[[1 1 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 1]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The code confirms there are 12 azure pixels, predicting 4 blue pixels to add.  The proposed locations are added to the working output grid.  I have visually inspected this and the locations seem reasonable given the training data.  I will now submit this grid.
