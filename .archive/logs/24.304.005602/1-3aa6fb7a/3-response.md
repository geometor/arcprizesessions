Based on the two examples provided, the transformation appears to be a stochastic process where a small, variable number of azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1) pixels.  There's no discernible geometric pattern or rule determining *which* azure pixels are altered.  The location of the changes seems random.

Let's use code to analyze the input and output grids more quantitatively.  We can count the number of azure pixels and the number changed to blue.  However, without more examples, it's impossible to find a deterministic rule, only a statistical description.

Example 1 Analysis:
  Initial Azure: 6
  Final Azure: 6
  Blue Pixels Added: 2
  Azure Pixels Changed: 0

Example 2 Analysis:
  Initial Azure: 9
  Final Azure: 9
  Blue Pixels Added: 3
  Azure Pixels Changed: 0

```

The code confirms that the number of azure pixels remains constant.  The change is the addition of blue pixels, not the transformation of existing azure pixels.  The number of blue pixels added appears to be somewhat related to the initial number of azure pixels (2 added with 6 initial, and 3 with 9 initial), but this is a weak correlation and not a reliable rule. We need significantly more examples to determine the precise transformation rule.  The fact that the Azure pixels don't change suggests we are dealing with addition of new elements rather than a transformation of existing ones.
