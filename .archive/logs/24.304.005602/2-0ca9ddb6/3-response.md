**example_3**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 2)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (65)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   A single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (7, 2)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red (2) and blue (1) pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the previous examples.  Yellow (4) crosses are added around red (2) pixels, and orange (7) crosses are added around blue (1) pixels.  The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.  The orange (7) pixels are adjacent to the blue (1) pixels.


**Overall Pattern (Consistent across all three examples):**

The rule remains consistent:

1.  Identify all pixels with value 1 (blue) and 2 (red).
2.  Add a cross-shaped pattern of yellow pixels (4) around each red pixel.
3.  Add a larger cross-shaped pattern of orange pixels (7) around each blue pixel, with the orange pixels directly touching the blue pixels.  Other colors remain unchanged.

I am ready for the test phase.
