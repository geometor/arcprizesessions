## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (61)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2).
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6).
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel, with the orange pixels touching the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; these new colors form crosses around the existing red and blue pixels, respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing pixels of colors 1 and 2.  The pattern suggests that:

1.  A cross pattern of yellow pixels is added around a red pixel.
2.  A cross pattern of orange pixels is added around a blue pixel.  These orange pixels directly touch the blue pixel.


Let me know if you'd like me to analyze more examples.  I'm ready for the next step.

**example_2**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (67)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0,3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,2) and (6,6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (53)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (12)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0,3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,2) and (6,6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross pattern around each of the red pixels.
    *   Twelve orange (7) pixels forming larger cross patterns around each of the blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 20
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example 1.  Yellow (4) crosses are added around red (2) pixels, and orange (7) crosses are added around blue (1) pixels.  The orange (7) pixels are adjacent to the blue (1) pixels. The size of the cross around blue pixels is larger than that around red pixels.

**Overall Pattern:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1.  Identify all pixels with value 1 (blue) and 2 (red).
2.  Add a cross-shaped pattern of yellow pixels (4) around each red pixel.
3.  Add a larger cross-shaped pattern of orange pixels (7) around each blue pixel, with the orange pixels directly touching the blue pixels.

I am ready for the test phase.
