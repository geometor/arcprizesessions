**example_2**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (67)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0,3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,2) and (6,6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (53)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (12)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single azure (8) pixel at (0,3)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,2) and (6,6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross pattern around each of the red pixels.
    *   Twelve orange (7) pixels forming larger cross patterns around each of the blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 20
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example 1.  Yellow (4) crosses are added around red (2) pixels, and orange (7) crosses are added around blue (1) pixels.  The orange (7) pixels are adjacent to the blue (1) pixels. The size of the cross around blue pixels is larger than that around red pixels.

**Overall Pattern:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1.  Identify all pixels with value 1 (blue) and 2 (red).
2.  Add a cross-shaped pattern of yellow pixels (4) around each red pixel.
3.  Add a larger cross-shaped pattern of orange pixels (7) around each blue pixel, with the orange pixels directly touching the blue pixels.

I am ready for the test phase.
