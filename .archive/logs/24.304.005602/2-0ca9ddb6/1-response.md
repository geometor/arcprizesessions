Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (61)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3, 2).
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6).
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel, with the orange pixels touching the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; these new colors form crosses around the existing red and blue pixels, respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing pixels of colors 1 and 2.  The pattern suggests that:

1.  A cross pattern of yellow pixels is added around a red pixel.
2.  A cross pattern of orange pixels is added around a blue pixel.  These orange pixels directly touch the blue pixel.
