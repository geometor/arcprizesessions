## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - A cluster of 5 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
  - Two new 'blue' (1) pixels added, one near the top and one near the bottom of the azure cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two 'azure' (8) pixels changed to 'blue' (1).  The change seems to be in locations near the edges/extremities of the main azure cluster.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve identifying the cluster of azure pixels and then adding a blue pixel near the top and bottom edges of this cluster.  It's not immediately clear what defines "top" and "bottom" within the cluster, but visually, it's related to the overall vertical orientation.  More examples are needed to confirm this pattern and define the rule precisely.

I need more examples to determine the precise rule for adding blue pixels to the azure cluster.  For example, what would happen if there were two separate clusters of azure? Would a blue pixel be added to each?  How would the rule handle a more complex, non-contiguous azure cluster?

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 9
objects:
  - A cluster of 9 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular, somewhat 'L' shaped form.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 37
  - 8: 9
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
  - Three new 'blue' (1) pixels added, one near the top and one near the bottom, and one to the left middle of the azure cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three 'azure' (8) pixels changed to 'blue' (1).  The changes seem to be near the edges/extremities of the main azure cluster, similar to example 1.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation in example_2 reinforces the pattern observed in example_1.  It appears that a blue pixel is added near the top, bottom, and possibly other extrema of the largest connected cluster of azure pixels.  The placement isn't precisely defined yet; there's some flexibility in the "near" placement.


**Comparison of Example 1 and 2:**

Both examples show the addition of blue (1) pixels near the edges of the largest connected component of azure (8) pixels.  Example 2 adds a blue pixel on the left side, indicating that "extremity" might include the leftmost and rightmost locations.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation rule seems to be:

1. Identify the largest connected component of azure (8) pixels.
2. Add a blue (1) pixel to the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost positions that are adjacent to the azure (8) pixels.  Consider only the positions that are not already occupied by an 8 or 1.

Further examples are needed to test this hypothesis more thoroughly, especially cases with multiple connected components of azure pixels, different shapes of azure clusters, or cases where the extrema are not unique (e.g., a perfectly square azure cluster).
