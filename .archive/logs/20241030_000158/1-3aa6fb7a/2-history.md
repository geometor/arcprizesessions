## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - A cluster of 5 'azure' (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same 'azure' (8) cluster as input.
  - Two new 'blue' (1) pixels added, one near the top and one near the bottom of the azure cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two 'azure' (8) pixels changed to 'blue' (1).  The change seems to be in locations near the edges/extremities of the main azure cluster.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve identifying the cluster of azure pixels and then adding a blue pixel near the top and bottom edges of this cluster.  It's not immediately clear what defines "top" and "bottom" within the cluster, but visually, it's related to the overall vertical orientation.  More examples are needed to confirm this pattern and define the rule precisely.

I need more examples to determine the precise rule for adding blue pixels to the azure cluster.  For example, what would happen if there were two separate clusters of azure? Would a blue pixel be added to each?  How would the rule handle a more complex, non-contiguous azure cluster?
