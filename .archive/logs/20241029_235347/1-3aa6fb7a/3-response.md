Based on the two examples provided, the transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to the outermost azure (8) pixels in a cluster. Let's summarize the observations and then use code to explore patterns and differences:

**Summary of Observations:**

The core transformation rule appears to be:  For each outermost azure (8) pixel (a pixel that is not completely surrounded by other azure pixels), add a single blue (1) pixel to an adjacent cell.  Adjacency includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors.

**Code Execution to Investigate Patterns:**

The following code will analyze the provided examples to further investigate the transformation rule. It will focus on identifying the outermost azure pixels and verifying the placement of the added blue pixels.

```
Example 1:
Outermost Azure pixels: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]

Example 2:
Outermost Azure pixels: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)]

```

The code successfully identifies the outermost azure pixels.  The next step would be to refine the code to verify that a blue pixel has been added adjacent to each identified outermost azure pixel in the output grids.  This would provide further validation of the hypothesis.  However, this requires a more sophisticated algorithm capable of handling potential multiple valid adjacent locations for each outermost pixel.

**Further Refinement of the Hypothesis:**

The current hypothesis is a good starting point, but it lacks the precision needed to handle edge cases.  We should consider:

1.  **Ambiguity in Adjacency:**  If multiple cells are adjacent to an outermost azure pixel, the algorithm needs to define which cell gets the blue pixel.  We might need more examples to determine the selection criteria (e.g., is there a preference for top, bottom, left, or right?).

2.  **Edge Cases:**  The algorithm must explicitly handle situations where the outermost azure pixels are on the edge of the grid.

3.  **Multiple Clusters:**  We need further examples to confirm how the algorithm behaves with multiple distinct clusters of azure pixels.


Once we have a more robust dataset, we can write a more refined algorithm to precisely describe the transformation.
