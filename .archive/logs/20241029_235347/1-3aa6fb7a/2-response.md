Here's an analysis of example_2, incorporating the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects: A cluster of azure (8) pixels, this time forming a more complex shape than the 'L' shape in example_1.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects: The azure cluster remains unchanged. Three blue (1) pixels have been added, each adjacent to an outermost azure pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three blue (1) pixels added.

**Transformation:**

The transformation in example_2 further supports the hypothesis from example_1:  A blue (1) pixel is added adjacent to each of the outermost azure (8) pixels.  This example adds more weight to the rule, confirming that the rule isn't restricted to an 'L' shape but can be generalized to a broader set of azure (8) pixel clusters.


**Addressing Questions from Example 1:**

1.  **Adjacent to outermost pixels:** This example clearly demonstrates the transformation rule applies to each *outermost* azure pixel.  It's not based on a specific distance.

2.  **Multiple bottom-most/right-most pixels:** This example didn't directly test this scenario. However, the consistent addition of a blue pixel to every outermost azure pixel implies that if there were multiple bottom-most/right-most pixels, a blue (1) pixel would likely be added next to *each* of them.

3.  **Different shape:** This example validates the rule's applicability to shapes more complex than the 'L' shape from example_1.

4.  **Multiple clusters:** Still requires additional examples to confirm how the rule would handle this.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

For each outermost azure (8) pixel in a cluster, add a blue (1) pixel to an adjacent cell.  "Outermost" refers to pixels that are not completely surrounded by other azure (8) pixels.  Adjacency includes diagonal and immediate horizontal/vertical adjacency.


**Next Steps:**

1.  More examples are needed, particularly to test cases with:
    *   Multiple azure (8) clusters.
    *   Azure (8) clusters touching edges of the grid.
    *   Cases where there are multiple equally valid candidate adjacent cells.

2.  Once enough examples are provided, a clearer and more precise algorithm can be constructed to solve this puzzle.  This algorithm will include conditions to handle edge cases (e.g., multiple valid candidates for adjacency).
