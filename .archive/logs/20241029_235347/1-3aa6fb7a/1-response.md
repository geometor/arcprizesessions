Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects: A single cluster of azure (8) pixels, somewhat resembling a vertically oriented 'L' shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:  The azure 'L' shape remains. Two blue (1) pixels have been added, one adjacent to each 'leg' of the azure 'L'.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two blue (1) pixels were added.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding a blue (1) pixel adjacent to each of the bottom-most and right-most azure (8) pixels.  The rule seems to be based on adjacency and position within the cluster.  There is a potential need to define "bottom-most" and "right-most" more precisely (e.g., what happens if there are multiple bottom-most pixels?).  It also needs clarification about what happens if a pixel is already adjacent (e.g., a blue pixel at a corner of the azure shape). More examples are needed for comprehensive rule definition.

Further questions before moving to the next step:

1.  Are the added blue pixels always adjacent to the cluster's outermost pixels, or is there a specific distance requirement?
2.  What happens if multiple azure pixels qualify as bottom-most or right-most? Is it the furthest one?
3.  How would this transform a different shape of the azure pixels cluster?
4.  What happens if there are multiple clusters of azure pixels?
