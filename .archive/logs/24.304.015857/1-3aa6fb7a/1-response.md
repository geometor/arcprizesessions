Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - A cluster of 8 (azure) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same azure cluster as input.
  - Two additional blue pixels (1) at positions (1,2) and (5,4).
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' (white) pixels changed to '1' (blue).
```

**transformation:**
```
The transformation appears to involve adding two blue pixels.  Their positions seem somewhat arbitrary, but  they might be related to the corners or edges of the azure cluster.  More examples are needed to determine the precise rule.  A possible hypothesis is that the algorithm identifies the bounding box of the azure cluster and adds a blue pixel to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the bounding box, if these corners are currently white.
```
