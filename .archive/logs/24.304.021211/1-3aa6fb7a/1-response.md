**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 41
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.
    - Two blue pixels, one near the top-center and one near the bottom-center, seemingly replacing some white pixels near the azure cluster.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two white pixels have been changed to blue pixels (1).


**transformation:**
  - Two white pixels adjacent to the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The pattern isn't immediately clear regarding placement or relationship with the azure cluster.  More examples are needed to determine a consistent rule.
