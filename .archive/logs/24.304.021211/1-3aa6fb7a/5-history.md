    - Three blue pixels, one each near the top, middle and bottom of the azure cluster.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three white pixels adjacent to azure pixels have changed to blue.


**transformation:**
  - White pixels adjacent to the azure cluster are changed to blue. The placement of the blue pixels seems somewhat arbitrary. More examples are needed to definitively determine the pattern.  It appears to be related to the proximity to the cluster and not simply adding to a specific location.



**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding blue pixels (1) adjacent to existing azure pixels (8).  The number and location of the added blue pixels vary, but they always seem to be immediately next to the azure cluster. There is not a consistent pattern to the location of the new blue pixels other than adjacency to the azure pixels.




# examples summary: 

Based on the two examples, the transformation involves adding blue pixels (value 1) adjacent to existing azure pixels (value 8).  The exact number and placement of the added blue pixels aren't strictly consistent, but they are always directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one azure pixel.  There is no apparent pattern to their positioning beyond this adjacency rule; it does not appear to be related to the overall shape or size of the azure cluster.

Let's use code to further analyze the differences and look for any other potential subtle patterns:

The `find_adjacent_white` function identifies white pixels adjacent to azure pixels. The output shows that there are multiple adjacent white pixels in both examples.  However, the transformation doesn't replace *all* adjacent white pixels with blue.  The selection of which white pixels to change remains unclear from these two examples alone. More examples are needed to establish a definitive rule.  The difference grids show that blue pixels are added to specific locations, but there's no obvious algorithm visible yet for predicting those locations based solely on the adjacency of white pixels to the azure clusters.

**Test Input:**

width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 37
  - 8: 12
objects:
  - A cluster of 12 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.


**Predicted Output:**

Based on the previous examples, I predict that the output will add blue pixels (1) adjacent to the existing azure pixels (8). The exact number and location are uncertain, but it's likely to involve several blue pixels.


**Test Phase - Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Initialize:**  Since the output is closely related to the input (only adding pixels), initialize the output grid from the input grid.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_output = np.copy(test_input)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

2. **Set Pixels:** I'll iterate through the `adjacent_white` coordinates identified earlier and set those pixels to blue (1), guided by the pattern from the examples, though I acknowledge uncertainty in the precise number and locations.  I will select a subset of these locations to start.  Reviewing the output grid after each addition will allow me to refine my strategy.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

adjacent_white = [(0, 4), (1, 5), (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (0, 1), (1, 5), (2, 6), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 2), (2, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 2)]

#select subset for first iteration, guided by previous examples
selected_adjacent = [(0,4), (1, 2), (4, 2), (5, 0)]

for r, c in selected_adjacent:
    test_output[r, c] = 1

print(f"{test_output=}")

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
test_output=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

This is a partial solution.  The selection of which adjacent white pixels to change to blue is still heuristic, and the next step would be to refine that selection by considering the examples and using additional heuristics or potentially machine learning if available. The current selection of white pixels is arbitrary, but it demonstrates my ability to proceed with a step-by-step solution.  The next step should involve examining the remaining `adjacent_white` coordinates and choosing more locations based on observations from the examples provided, but more examples would be needed to make that determination in a deterministic way.  For instance, I could explore the heuristic of choosing pixels that are closest to the center of mass of the azure cluster.


## initialize the working output grid

use function_call to initialize the working output grid:

- initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output

- initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
