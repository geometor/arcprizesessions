The working output grid has been initialized correctly from the input grid.  Let's investigate further using code. I'll add more blue pixels based on proximity to the azure cluster.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

#test_input is defined from previous code block

def distance(r1, c1, r2, c2):
    return abs(r1 - r2) + abs(c1 - c2)

def find_closest_white(grid, r, c):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    min_dist = float('inf')
    closest_coords = None
    for nr in range(rows):
        for nc in range(cols):
            if grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                dist = distance(r, c, nr, nc)
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    closest_coords = (nr, nc)
    return closest_coords

test_output = np.copy(test_input) # re-initialize from the original test_input

for r in range(test_input.shape[0]):
    for c in range(test_input.shape[1]):
        if test_input[r, c] == 8:
            closest_white = find_closest_white(test_input, r, c)
            if closest_white:
                nr, nc = closest_white
                test_output[nr, nc] = 1

print(test_output)

```
