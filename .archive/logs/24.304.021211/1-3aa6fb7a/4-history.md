**input:**
  width: 7

  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 8
  objects:
    - A cluster of 8 azure pixels forming a roughly L shape.

  objects:
    - A cluster of 8 azure pixels forming a roughly L shape.
    - Three blue pixels, one each near the top, middle and bottom of the azure cluster.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three white pixels adjacent to azure pixels have changed to blue.


**transformation:**
  - White pixels adjacent to the azure cluster are changed to blue. The placement of the blue pixels seems somewhat arbitrary. More examples are needed to definitively determine the pattern.  It appears to be related to the proximity to the cluster and not simply adding to a specific location.



**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding blue pixels (1) adjacent to existing azure pixels (8).  The number and location of the added blue pixels vary, but they always seem to be immediately next to the azure cluster. There is not a consistent pattern to the location of the new blue pixels other than adjacency to the azure pixels.




# examples summary: 

Based on the two examples, the transformation involves adding blue pixels (value 1) adjacent to existing azure pixels (value 8).  The exact number and placement of the added blue pixels aren't strictly consistent, but they are always directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one azure pixel.  There is no apparent pattern to their positioning beyond this adjacency rule; it does not appear to be related to the overall shape or size of the azure cluster.

Let's use code to further analyze the differences and look for any other potential subtle patterns:

The `find_adjacent_white` function identifies white pixels adjacent to azure pixels. The output shows that there are multiple adjacent white pixels in both examples.  However, the transformation doesn't replace *all* adjacent white pixels with blue.  The selection of which white pixels to change remains unclear from these two examples alone. More examples are needed to establish a definitive rule.  The difference grids show that blue pixels are added to specific locations, but there's no obvious algorithm visible yet for predicting those locations based solely on the adjacency of white pixels to the azure clusters.
