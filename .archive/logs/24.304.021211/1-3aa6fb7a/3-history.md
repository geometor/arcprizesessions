**input:**
  width: 7

  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 41
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.
    - Two blue pixels, one near the top-center and one near the bottom-center, seemingly replacing some white pixels near the azure cluster.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two white pixels have been changed to blue pixels (1).


**transformation:**
  - Two white pixels adjacent to the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The pattern isn't immediately clear regarding placement or relationship with the azure cluster.  More examples are needed to determine a consistent rule.

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 8
  objects:
    - A cluster of 8 azure pixels forming a roughly L shape.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 8
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - A cluster of 8 azure pixels forming a roughly L shape.
    - Three blue pixels, one each near the top, middle and bottom of the azure cluster.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three white pixels adjacent to azure pixels have changed to blue.


**transformation:**
  - White pixels adjacent to the azure cluster are changed to blue. The placement of the blue pixels seems somewhat arbitrary. More examples are needed to definitively determine the pattern.  It appears to be related to the proximity to the cluster and not simply adding to a specific location.



**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding blue pixels (1) adjacent to existing azure pixels (8).  The number and location of the added blue pixels vary, but they always seem to be immediately next to the azure cluster. There is not a consistent pattern to the location of the new blue pixels other than adjacency to the azure pixels.
