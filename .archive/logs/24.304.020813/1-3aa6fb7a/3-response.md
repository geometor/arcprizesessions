The transformation consistently adds blue (1) pixels adjacent to light blue (8) pixels in the input grid.  The number of blue pixels added appears to correlate with the number of light blue pixels having at least one adjacent white (0) pixel.  Specifically, for each light blue (8) pixel with at least one adjacent white (0) pixel, a single blue (1) pixel is added to an adjacent white (0) cell. The selection of the specific adjacent cell for the new blue pixel seems somewhat arbitrary but consistent within each example.

Let's verify this hypothesis with code.  The following code will analyze the input and output grids to check if the transformation rule holds for each example:




code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    output_array = np.array(output_grid)
    diff_array = output_array - input_array
    
    light_blue_indices = np.where(input_array == 8)
    
    added_blue_count = np.sum(diff_array == 1)
    
    eligible_light_blue_count = 0
    for i, j in zip(*light_blue_indices):
        if i > 0 and input_array[i-1,j] == 0:
            eligible_light_blue_count +=1
        elif i < input_array.shape[0] -1 and input_array[i+1,j] == 0:
            eligible_light_blue_count += 1
        elif j > 0 and input_array[i,j-1] == 0:
            eligible_light_blue_count += 1
        elif j < input_array.shape[1]-1 and input_array[i,j+1] == 0:
            eligible_light_blue_count += 1

    print(f"Added Blue Pixels: {added_blue_count}")
    print(f"Eligible Light Blue Pixels (with adjacent 0): {eligible_light_blue_count}")
    return added_blue_count == eligible_light_blue_count

```
Added Blue Pixels: 2
Eligible Light Blue Pixels (with adjacent 0): 6
Example 1 matches hypothesis: False
Added Blue Pixels: 3
Eligible Light Blue Pixels (with adjacent 0): 9
Example 2 matches hypothesis: False

```

The code reveals that the initial hypothesis, while close, is not perfectly accurate. The count of eligible light blue pixels (those with at least one adjacent 0) significantly exceeds the number of added blue pixels.  This suggests a more nuanced rule might be at play.  Perhaps only a subset of the eligible light blue pixels get a blue pixel added, or there might be additional constraints we haven't considered.


Let's refine our analysis by considering proximity and the overall shape of the light-blue cluster. The added blue pixels seem to preferentially fill gaps or expand the cluster's perimeter. A more sophisticated algorithm considering adjacency, cluster shape, and maybe even the number of adjacent zeros is needed to accurately capture the transformation rules.  More examples would greatly aid this process.
