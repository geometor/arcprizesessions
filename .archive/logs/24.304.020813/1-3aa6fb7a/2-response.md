Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a refined hypothesis about the transformation:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - A cluster of light blue (8) pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 38
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - Similar light blue (8) cluster as in the input.
  - Three blue (1) pixels have appeared, each adjacent to a light blue (8) pixel.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '0' cells changed to '1' (blue).  The new blue pixels are adjacent to existing light blue (8) pixels.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with example_1.  It appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to each light blue (8) pixel in the cluster.  The number of blue pixels added seems to be related to the number of light blue (8) pixels that have an adjacent '0'.  Let's refine our hypothesis:

**Refined Transformation Hypothesis:**

For each light blue (8) pixel that has at least one adjacent '0' (white) pixel, a blue (1) pixel is added to an adjacent '0' cell. The choice of which adjacent '0' cell to fill seems arbitrary, but consistent within the example.



**Overall Pattern:**

The overall pattern appears to be about expanding a cluster of light blue (8) pixels by adding blue (1) pixels to its perimeter, one at a time, adjacent to the existing light blue pixels.

To further test this hypothesis, more examples would be needed, including cases with different cluster sizes, shapes, and the presence of other colors, if the hypothesis is correct, any 8 adjacent to a zero will gain an adjacent 1 in the output.
