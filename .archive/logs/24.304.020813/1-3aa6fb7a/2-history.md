## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of light blue (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Similar light blue (8) cluster as in the input.
  - Two blue (1) pixels have appeared, one above and one below a light blue pixel in the cluster
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' cells have changed to '1' (blue).  The new blue pixels appear adjacent to existing light blue (8) pixels.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue (1) pixels. These new pixels are placed adjacent (directly above and below) to existing light blue (8) pixels within the light blue cluster.  There seems to be a rule for the placement of the new blue pixels relative to existing light blue pixels but more examples are needed to verify this hypothesis.  It's not clear yet if there's a specific number of blue pixels added, or if it's a function of the cluster size or shape.
