Based on the analysis of the examples and the application of the hypothesis to the test case, I am ready to submit the solution.  The solution, as determined by the iterative pixel change based on adjacency to white pixels is presented below. Note, this solution might not be pixel-perfect due to potential ambiguities in the rule, which need further examples to refine.

**Proposed Solution:**



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                      [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

print(output_grid)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

This solution reflects the iterative application of the hypothesis that pixels adjacent to white(0) are changed to blue(1).  The selection is not fully deterministic and may require further examples to fine-tune.  I am submitting this solution for evaluation.
