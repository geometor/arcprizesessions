Here's an analysis of the test input, following the established format:

code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

def count_adjacent_white(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    count = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i, j] == 8:  # Light-blue pixel
                # Check adjacent pixels (excluding diagonals)
                if i > 0 and grid[i - 1, j] == 0:
                    count += 1
                if i < rows - 1 and grid[i + 1, j] == 0:
                    count += 1
                if j > 0 and grid[i, j - 1] == 0:
                    count += 1
                if j < cols - 1 and grid[i, j + 1] == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count

adjacent_white_count = count_adjacent_white(test_input)
print(f"Test input adjacent white count: {adjacent_white_count}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Test input adjacent white count: 23

```

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 32
    - 8: 11
  objects:
    - A cluster of 11 light-blue (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.  It's somewhat fragmented.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:  (predicted)
    - 0: 32  (unchanged)
    - 8: 11 - x (unchanged)
    - 1: y (where y is predicted number of changed pixels)
  objects: (predicted)
    - A cluster of 11 light-blue (8) pixels with some converted to blue (1).


**differences:**
  cells_changed: (predicted) y
  colors_changed: (predicted) Some light-blue (8) pixels changed to blue (1).


**transformation:**
  - Based on previous examples, the transformation will likely involve changing some light-blue (8) pixels to blue (1).  The number of changed pixels is uncertain but likely less than 23 (the total count of light-blue pixels adjacent to white pixels). The selection will likely prioritize pixels at or near the perimeter of the light-blue clusters.  The selection seems to be non-deterministic in precise location but consistently chooses a subset of edge-adjacent pixels.


**Test Phase:**

Let's begin constructing the output grid step-by-step.

1. **Initialize:** Since the output is closely related to the input, let's initialize the output grid from the input.

code_execution:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

output_grid = np.copy(test_input)
print(output_grid)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

2. **Set Pixels:** Now let's iteratively change some light-blue pixels to blue.  I will prioritize pixels adjacent to white pixels, starting from the perimeter and working inwards.

code_execution:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

#Change pixels based on adjacency to white pixels
rows, cols = output_grid.shape
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        if output_grid[i, j] == 8:
            if i > 0 and output_grid[i-1, j] == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = 1
                break
            if i < rows -1 and output_grid[i+1, j] == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = 1
                break
            if j > 0 and output_grid[i, j-1] == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = 1
                break
            if j < cols - 1 and output_grid[i, j+1] == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = 1
                break

print(output_grid)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

That looks like a reasonable transformation based on the observed pattern.  The algorithm selected several light-blue pixels adjacent to white pixels and changed them to blue.  The number of changes (7) is less than the total number of adjacent pixels (23), and the selection seems consistent with the prior examples.

**Submit:**

I'm ready to submit this output grid as the solution to the puzzle.  The transformation is consistent with what was learned from the examples, which is that a subset of light-blue pixels adjacent to white pixels get transformed to blue pixels.  The number of pixels changed seems to depend on the overall structure and the number of perimeter pixels, but a precise rule is still not fully evident.
