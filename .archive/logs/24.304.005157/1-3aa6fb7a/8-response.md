Okay, I've added a blue pixel at (1, 1).  Let's analyze the current state and continue iteratively.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label

grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                 [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                 [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                 [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

labeled_grid, num_features = label(grid)
print(f"Number of connected components: {num_features}")

#Find largest cluster
largest_cluster_label = -1
largest_cluster_size = 0
for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
  indices = np.where(labeled_grid == label_num)
  size = len(indices[0])
  if size > largest_cluster_size:
      largest_cluster_size = size
      largest_cluster_label = label_num

print(f"Largest cluster label: {largest_cluster_label}")

adjacent_white_counts = {}
for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
    indices = np.where(labeled_grid == label_num)
    coords = list(zip(indices[0], indices[1]))
    count = 0
    for r, c in coords:
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                count += 1
    adjacent_white_counts[label_num] = count

print(f"Adjacent white cell counts per component: {adjacent_white_counts}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Number of connected components: 4
Largest cluster label: 1
Adjacent white cell counts per component: {1: 4, 2: 6, 3: 8, 4: 5}

```

The largest cluster is still label 1.  The analysis shows that there are still adjacent white cells to the largest cluster. Let's continue adding blue pixels iteratively, focusing on the largest cluster's perimeter.

function_call:
set_pixel(0,1,1)

result:
set_pixel(row=0, column=1, color=1)

[[0 1 0 0 0 8 8]

 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]
