## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
print(f'{diff_grid=}')

```

diff_grid=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 light-blue (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 41
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - A cluster of 6 light-blue (8) pixels.
    - Two isolated blue (1) pixels.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two light-blue (8) pixels changed to blue (1).  These are located at the bottom-right and top-right of the light-blue cluster.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to involve changing some of the light-blue pixels to blue pixels. Specifically, it seems that the light-blue pixels at the "top-right" and "bottom-right"  extremities of the cluster are changed to blue.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and define "extremity" more precisely.  The transformation may depend on the overall shape and orientation of the cluster.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                       [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
print(f'{diff_grid=}')

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
diff_grid=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 9
  objects:
    - A cluster of 9 light-blue (8) pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 9
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - A cluster of 9 light-blue (8) pixels.
    - Three isolated blue (1) pixels.


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three light-blue (8) pixels changed to blue (1). These appear to be on the "outer edges" of the cluster, but not necessarily at the extremities as in Example 1.  The placement seems less deterministic and more scattered than in Example 1.


**transformation:**
  - Similar to Example 1, the transformation involves changing some light-blue (8) pixels to blue (1). However, the selection of pixels seems less consistent. It appears to select some pixels from the periphery of the light-blue cluster but without an obvious geometrical rule, which is different from Example 1.  The pattern may relate to the proximity to white pixels.  More data is needed to fully understand the transformation rules.

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation seems to involve converting some light blue (8) pixels to blue (1).  The selection of pixels for conversion is not clearly defined by geometry alone. The location of the converted pixels seems to be related to the edges of the light-blue cluster.  Further examples might reveal whether there are other factors determining which light-blue pixels get converted to blue.  Consider testing the hypothesis that pixels at the perimeter are chosen for conversion.  The pattern does not appear to be purely geometric.



# examples summary: 

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
