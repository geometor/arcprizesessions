Based on the two examples, the transformation consistently involves changing some light-blue (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. However, the selection of which light-blue pixels are changed isn't purely geometric.  The examples suggest a relationship between the selection and the perimeter of the light-blue cluster.  Pixels on the edge or near the edge of the light-blue cluster seem more likely to be changed.

Let's summarize the observed pattern and propose a hypothesis for the transformation.

**Observed Pattern Summary:**

1. **Input:** A grid containing a cluster of light-blue (8) pixels, possibly irregular in shape.  The remainder of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
2. **Output:** The same grid as the input, but with some light-blue (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.
3. **Pixel Selection:** The pixels changed from light-blue to blue are located on or near the perimeter of the light-blue cluster. The number of pixels changed seems to be correlated with the cluster's size but not in a strictly proportional way.
4. **No clear geometric rule:**  There's no easily discernible geometric rule (like "corners," "extremities," or specific edge locations) defining which pixels are changed.


**Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves selecting light-blue pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels and changing them to blue (1).  The selection may prioritize perimeter pixels, but there might be other factors influencing the choice of specific pixels.  A more comprehensive test needs to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis.  The number of pixels changed may be related to the cluster's size or perimeter length but a precise mathematical relationship has not yet been established.


**Code Execution for Further Analysis:**

The following code will analyze the adjacency of light-blue (8) pixels to white (0) pixels in the input grids of the examples.  The code will count the number of such adjacent pixels.  This is to help to determine the correlation between adjacent pixels and the resulting transformation.

```python

import numpy as np

def count_adjacent_white(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    count = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i, j] == 8:  # Light-blue pixel
                # Check adjacent pixels (excluding diagonals)
                if i > 0 and grid[i - 1, j] == 0:
                    count += 1
                if i < rows - 1 and grid[i + 1, j] == 0:
                    count += 1
                if j > 0 and grid[i, j - 1] == 0:
                    count += 1
                if j < cols - 1 and grid[i, j + 1] == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count


example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                      [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

print(f"Example 1 adjacent white count: {count_adjacent_white(example1_input)}")
print(f"Example 2 adjacent white count: {count_adjacent_white(example2_input)}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 adjacent white count: 16
Example 2 adjacent white count: 20

```

The `count_adjacent_white` function counts the number of light-blue (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels. The output shows that Example 1 has 16 such pixels, while Example 2 has 20.  This supports the hypothesis that  the transformation involves selecting a subset of these adjacent pixels.  However, the number of pixels converted to blue in each example is less than the total count of adjacent pixels (2 vs 16 and 3 vs 20, respectively). This indicates there's more to the rule than simply counting adjacent pixels. More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and potentially identify additional criteria determining the selection of light blue pixels to convert to blue.
