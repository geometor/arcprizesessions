Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - A cluster of 8 (azure) pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same azure cluster as in the input.
  - Two new blue (1) pixels have appeared, one adjacent to the top and one adjacent to the bottom of the azure cluster.  Both are on the perimeter of the cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' (white) pixels changed to '1' (blue).
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to add a blue pixel adjacent to the top and bottom of the main azure cluster.  The placement seems to be determined by the perimeter of the azure cluster.  There's no obvious mathematical pattern or geometric operation beyond this proximity relation.  A possible rule is:  "Identify the topmost and bottommost azure pixels. Find the adjacent white pixels. Convert those white pixels to blue."
