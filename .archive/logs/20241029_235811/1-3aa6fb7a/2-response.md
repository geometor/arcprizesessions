Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - A cluster of 8 (azure) pixels forming a more complex, non-contiguous shape than in example 1.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - Same azure cluster as in the input.
  - Three new blue (1) pixels have appeared, each adjacent to an azure pixel, but not necessarily at the top or bottom.  They seem to maintain a perimeter relationship around the main azure cluster.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '0' (white) pixels changed to '1' (blue).
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation in example_2 refines the pattern observed in example_1.  It's not just about adding blue pixels to the top and bottom; instead, it appears to be about adding blue pixels adjacent to *any*  white pixel that directly touches an azure pixel. The rule seems to be more accurately stated as : "For each azure pixel, if there is at least one adjacent white pixel, transform one such adjacent white pixel to blue."  This accounts for the multiple blue pixels added in different locations around the azure cluster in this example.

**Comparison with example_1:**

Both examples show the addition of blue pixels around a cluster of azure pixels.  Example 2 generalizes the rule from example 1 making it more robust and applicable to differently shaped azure clusters. The key consistent element is the adjacency relationship between azure and newly added blue pixels.  The transformation is clearly focused on the perimeter of the azure object(s).

**Revised Overall Transformation Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, a working hypothesis is that the transformation involves identifying all white pixels adjacent to azure pixels. Then, one of those white pixels for each adjacent pair is changed to blue.  The selection of which adjacent white pixel is changed to blue is not fully defined in these examples.  More examples might reveal any subtle rules about which of the multiple possible white pixels to select.
