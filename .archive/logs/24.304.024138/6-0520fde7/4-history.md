# example_1

## input:

[[1 0 0 5 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 5 1 1 1]
 [1 0 0 5 0 0 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7553EAF05630>


## output:

[[0 0 0]
 [0 2 0]
 [0 0 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553E99DBDF0>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 11
    *   1 (blue): 5
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   **objects:**  A vertical gray column in the center. Blue pixels appear clustered around the gray column.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 3
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 8
    *   2 (red): 1
*   **objects:** A single red pixel in the center.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16 cells changed from the input.
*   **colors_changed:** The output is significantly smaller and contains different colors. Most cells went from blue, gray or white to white. One cell became red.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The size reduction is drastic, and the output seems to focus on a specific location related to the input's dominant feature (the central gray column). It's possible the algorithm identifies the central column, finds its central pixel, and then creates a smaller grid around it and replace the center pixel with red. More examples are needed to validate this hypothesis.

Further investigation is needed, especially with additional examples to ascertain whether a spatial relationship between the input's larger gray column and the output's single red pixel is consistently observed.  The drastic size change also suggests there may be a rule determining the output dimensions based on some property of the input.


# example_2

## input:

[[1 1 0 5 0 1 0]
 [0 0 1 5 1 1 1]
 [1 1 0 5 0 1 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7553EAF83AF0>


## output:

[[0 2 0]
 [0 0 2]
 [0 2 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EA3A1000>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a revised hypothesis about the transformation:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 11
    *   1 (blue): 7
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   **objects:** A vertical gray column in the center.  Blue pixels are more numerous and clustered around the central gray column compared to example 1.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 3
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 6
    *   2 (red): 3
*   **objects:** Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern with the center red pixel overlapping the center pixel.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16 cells changed from the input.
*   **colors_changed:** Similar to example 1, the output is much smaller.  The central column's location is reflected in the red cross pattern in the output.


**Transformation (Revised Hypothesis):**

Comparing example 1 and 2 reveals a consistent pattern:

1.  **Central Column Identification:** The algorithm identifies the central column of the input grid.

2.  **Size Reduction:** The output grid's dimensions seem to be related to the height of the input (it is always 3 x 3 and the input height is always 3).

3.  **Central Pixel Mapping:** The central pixel of the central column in the input maps to the center of the output.

4.  **Color Change and Pattern:** The central pixel in the output changes to red.  The pattern of red pixels in the output seems to be influenced by the number and distribution of blue and gray pixels surrounding the central column in the input. The more blue pixels in the surrounding area, the more red pixels in the output.


**Further Considerations:**

*   **Handling of variations:** The pattern of red pixels in the output may change depending on the distribution of colors around the central column. Further examples are needed to confirm this.
*   **Edge Cases:** We need more examples to understand what happens when the central column doesn't have a clearly defined center or when the input has different heights.


In summary, the transformation appears to involve identifying a central column, reducing the grid size to 3x3, and mapping the central pixel to the center of the output, coloring it red, and then possibly adding additional red pixels based on the surrounding colors in the input.  More examples are crucial to solidify this hypothesis and explore potential edge cases.


# example_3

## input:

[[0 0 1 5 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 5 1 0 1]
 [0 1 1 5 1 0 1]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7553EACDF550>


## output:

[[0 0 0]
 [2 0 0]
 [0 0 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EA3A1780>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, followed by a refined hypothesis:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 11
    *   1 (blue): 6
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   **objects:** A central gray column. Blue pixels are clustered around it, but less densely than in example 2.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 3
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 7
    *   2 (red): 2
*   **objects:** Two red pixels; one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right.  No central red pixel.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16 cells changed from the input.
*   **colors_changed:** The output is smaller; two pixels are red.


**Transformation (Refined Hypothesis):**

Example 3 introduces a nuance: the number of surrounding blue pixels seems to influence the *pattern* of red pixels in the 3x3 output, not just the total number.

Let's refine our hypothesis:

1.  **Central Column Identification:** The algorithm still identifies the central column.

2.  **Size Reduction:**  The output remains a 3x3 grid.

3.  **Central Pixel Mapping:** The central pixel of the central column in the input maps to the center of the output grid.  However, the *color* of this central pixel in the output is now conditional.

4.  **Conditional Color Change and Pattern:** The central pixel in the output becomes red *only if* there is a sufficient number of blue pixels adjacent to the central column in the input (this threshold needs further investigation across more examples). If the number of adjacent blue pixels falls below a threshold, only some other pixels are coloured red based on the surrounding blue pixel count.  There's a pattern emerging:  a higher concentration of blue pixels near the central column results in more red pixels in the output, but their arrangement changes.

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Threshold Determination:**  The exact threshold for the number of adjacent blue pixels needed to color the central output pixel red requires more data points.
*   **Red Pixel Placement:** The placement of red pixels when the central pixel isn't red needs further investigation.  It seems influenced by the distribution of blue pixels.  It might be a rule based on adjacency, or it might be positional based on the pattern of blue pixels. More examples are needed to explore the algorithm behind the red pixels placement.
*   **Input height:** The examples suggest that output grid is a 3x3 grid even when input grid height is 3. This assumption will be tested as more examples are provided.



We need more examples to definitively determine the threshold and the precise rules governing red pixel placement when the central pixel isn't colored red.  The relationship between blue pixel distribution and output pattern needs further exploration.
