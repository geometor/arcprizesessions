The transformation from input to output grid involves several steps:

1. **Central Column Identification:** The algorithm identifies the central column of the input grid.  This column always contains the value '5' in the provided examples.

2. **Size Reduction:** Regardless of the input's width, the output grid is always 3x3.

3. **Central Pixel Mapping:** The central pixel of the central column in the input maps to the center of the 3x3 output grid.

4. **Conditional Color Change:** The central pixel of the output grid (corresponding to the central pixel of the input's central column) turns red (value 2) based on a condition.  This condition appears to relate to the number of blue (value 1) pixels adjacent to the central column in the input grid.

5. **Pattern of Red Pixels:** If the condition in step 4 isn't met (insufficient adjacent blue pixels), other pixels in the output grid may turn red, creating a pattern that seems to reflect the distribution of blue pixels around the central column.  The pattern isn't fully defined yet, but it shows a correlation between the number and distribution of blue pixels in the input and the pattern of red pixels in the output.



Let's use code to analyze the adjacency of blue pixels:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def count_adjacent_blue(input_grid):
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    height, width = input_array.shape
    central_column_index = width // 2
    central_pixel_row = height // 2
    central_pixel_value = input_array[central_pixel_row, central_column_index]
    
    if central_pixel_value != 5:
      return -1 # This is not a valid example for the current pattern

    count = 0
    for i in range(max(0, central_pixel_row - 1), min(height, central_pixel_row + 2)):
        for j in range(max(0, central_column_index - 1), min(width, central_column_index + 2)):
            if input_array[i, j] == 1 and (i != central_pixel_row or j != central_column_index):
                count += 1
    return count

example1_input = [[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                 [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                 [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]
example2_input = [[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                 [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                 [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]]
example3_input = [[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                 [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]]

print(f"Adjacent blue pixels in example 1: {count_adjacent_blue(example1_input)}")
print(f"Adjacent blue pixels in example 2: {count_adjacent_blue(example2_input)}")
print(f"Adjacent blue pixels in example 3: {count_adjacent_blue(example3_input)}")

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Adjacent blue pixels in example 1: 1
Adjacent blue pixels in example 2: 2
Adjacent blue pixels in example 3: 4

```

The `tool_code` output shows a correlation:  Example 1 has one adjacent blue pixel, and the output has only one red. Example 2 has two, and the output has three (a cross). Example 3 has four, and the output has two red pixels, diagonally opposite.  This suggests a threshold might exist. If the count of adjacent blue pixels exceeds a certain amount, multiple red pixels appear, otherwise, a single central red pixel appears. More examples are needed to define this threshold and pattern more precisely.  The position of the additional red pixels also warrants further investigation; more examples might reveal a consistent positional rule.
