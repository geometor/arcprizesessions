The initialized output grid is correct.  The next step is to set the pixels according to my prediction, which is based on the observation that with 4 adjacent blue pixels, the output shows two red pixels diagonally opposite.

Let's set the pixels using the `set_pixel` function:


code_execution:


code_execution:

```python

def set_pixel(grid, row, col, value):
    grid[row][col] = value

output_grid = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
set_pixel(output_grid, 0, 1, 2) # Top-middle
set_pixel(output_grid, 1, 0, 2) # Middle-left
set_pixel(output_grid, 2, 2, 2) # Bottom-right

print(output_grid)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2]]

```

The updated `output_grid` reflects the predicted pattern. I'm ready to submit this as the final solution.
