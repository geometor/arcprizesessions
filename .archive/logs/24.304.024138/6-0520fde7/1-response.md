Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 11
    *   1 (blue): 5
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   **objects:**  A vertical gray column in the center. Blue pixels appear clustered around the gray column.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 3
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 8
    *   2 (red): 1
*   **objects:** A single red pixel in the center.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16 cells changed from the input.
*   **colors_changed:** The output is significantly smaller and contains different colors. Most cells went from blue, gray or white to white. One cell became red.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The size reduction is drastic, and the output seems to focus on a specific location related to the input's dominant feature (the central gray column). It's possible the algorithm identifies the central column, finds its central pixel, and then creates a smaller grid around it and replace the center pixel with red. More examples are needed to validate this hypothesis.

Further investigation is needed, especially with additional examples to ascertain whether a spatial relationship between the input's larger gray column and the output's single red pixel is consistently observed.  The drastic size change also suggests there may be a rule determining the output dimensions based on some property of the input.
