Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a revised hypothesis about the transformation:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 11
    *   1 (blue): 7
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   **objects:** A vertical gray column in the center.  Blue pixels are more numerous and clustered around the central gray column compared to example 1.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 3
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 6
    *   2 (red): 3
*   **objects:** Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern with the center red pixel overlapping the center pixel.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16 cells changed from the input.
*   **colors_changed:** Similar to example 1, the output is much smaller.  The central column's location is reflected in the red cross pattern in the output.


**Transformation (Revised Hypothesis):**

Comparing example 1 and 2 reveals a consistent pattern:

1.  **Central Column Identification:** The algorithm identifies the central column of the input grid.

2.  **Size Reduction:** The output grid's dimensions seem to be related to the height of the input (it is always 3 x 3 and the input height is always 3).

3.  **Central Pixel Mapping:** The central pixel of the central column in the input maps to the center of the output.

4.  **Color Change and Pattern:** The central pixel in the output changes to red.  The pattern of red pixels in the output seems to be influenced by the number and distribution of blue and gray pixels surrounding the central column in the input. The more blue pixels in the surrounding area, the more red pixels in the output.


**Further Considerations:**

*   **Handling of variations:** The pattern of red pixels in the output may change depending on the distribution of colors around the central column. Further examples are needed to confirm this.
*   **Edge Cases:** We need more examples to understand what happens when the central column doesn't have a clearly defined center or when the input has different heights.


In summary, the transformation appears to involve identifying a central column, reducing the grid size to 3x3, and mapping the central pixel to the center of the output, coloring it red, and then possibly adding additional red pixels based on the surrounding colors in the input.  More examples are crucial to solidify this hypothesis and explore potential edge cases.
