Here's an analysis of example_3, followed by a refined hypothesis:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 7
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 11
    *   1 (blue): 6
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   **objects:** A central gray column. Blue pixels are clustered around it, but less densely than in example 2.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 3
*   **height:** 3
*   **colors:**
    *   0 (white): 7
    *   2 (red): 2
*   **objects:** Two red pixels; one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right.  No central red pixel.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16 cells changed from the input.
*   **colors_changed:** The output is smaller; two pixels are red.


**Transformation (Refined Hypothesis):**

Example 3 introduces a nuance: the number of surrounding blue pixels seems to influence the *pattern* of red pixels in the 3x3 output, not just the total number.

Let's refine our hypothesis:

1.  **Central Column Identification:** The algorithm still identifies the central column.

2.  **Size Reduction:**  The output remains a 3x3 grid.

3.  **Central Pixel Mapping:** The central pixel of the central column in the input maps to the center of the output grid.  However, the *color* of this central pixel in the output is now conditional.

4.  **Conditional Color Change and Pattern:** The central pixel in the output becomes red *only if* there is a sufficient number of blue pixels adjacent to the central column in the input (this threshold needs further investigation across more examples). If the number of adjacent blue pixels falls below a threshold, only some other pixels are coloured red based on the surrounding blue pixel count.  There's a pattern emerging:  a higher concentration of blue pixels near the central column results in more red pixels in the output, but their arrangement changes.

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Threshold Determination:**  The exact threshold for the number of adjacent blue pixels needed to color the central output pixel red requires more data points.
*   **Red Pixel Placement:** The placement of red pixels when the central pixel isn't red needs further investigation.  It seems influenced by the distribution of blue pixels.  It might be a rule based on adjacency, or it might be positional based on the pattern of blue pixels. More examples are needed to explore the algorithm behind the red pixels placement.
*   **Input height:** The examples suggest that output grid is a 3x3 grid even when input grid height is 3. This assumption will be tested as more examples are provided.



We need more examples to definitively determine the threshold and the precise rules governing red pixel placement when the central pixel isn't colored red.  The relationship between blue pixel distribution and output pattern needs further exploration.
