Here's an analysis of the test input, followed by the predicted output and code to generate it:

**Test Input Analysis:**



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

print(f"Test Input Shape: {test_input.shape}")
#Find Azure blocks
def find_connected_blocks(grid, color):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
    blocks = []

    def dfs(row, col, current_block):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color:
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        current_block.append((row, col))
        dfs(row + 1, col, current_block)
        dfs(row - 1, col, current_block)
        dfs(row, col + 1, current_block)
        dfs(row, col - 1, current_block)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:
                current_block = []
                dfs(r, c, current_block)
                blocks.append(current_block)

    return blocks

azure_blocks = find_connected_blocks(test_input, 8)
print(f"Azure Blocks: {azure_blocks}")


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Test Input Shape: (7, 7)
Azure Blocks: [[(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)], [(1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1)], [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)], [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]]

```

The test input has several blocks of azure pixels.  The `find_connected_blocks` function identifies these as expected.  Let's proceed with the transformation.

**Predicted Output:**

The transformation will add a blue pixel to the top-right of each block of azure that's at least 2x2 in size.  Let's use the `transform_grid` function from previous code execution to generate the predicted output.




code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def find_connected_blocks(grid, color):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
    blocks = []

    def dfs(row, col, current_block):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color:
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        current_block.append((row, col))
        dfs(row + 1, col, current_block)
        dfs(row - 1, col, current_block)
        dfs(row, col + 1, current_block)
        dfs(row, col - 1, current_block)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:
                current_block = []
                dfs(r, c, current_block)
                blocks.append(current_block)

    return blocks

def transform_grid(grid):
    azure_blocks = find_connected_blocks(grid, 8)
    output_grid = np.copy(grid)
    for block in azure_blocks:
        min_row = min(r for r, c in block)
        min_col = min(c for r, c in block)
        max_row = max(r for r, c in block)
        max_col = max(c for r, c in block)
        
        #Check for minimum size
        if (max_row - min_row +1 >=2) and (max_col - min_col + 1 >=2):
            output_grid[min_row, max_col] = 1

    return output_grid

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

predicted_output = transform_grid(test_input)
print(f'{predicted_output=}')


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
predicted_output=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],
       [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

This is the predicted output grid based on the transformation rule derived from the examples.  The code correctly identifies the blocks and adds the blue pixels to the top-right of the qualifying blocks.  The size check within the `transform_grid` function is crucial for accuracy.
