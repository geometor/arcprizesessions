The working output grid has been initialized correctly from the input grid.  Let's verify the next step using the `transform_grid` function and then update the working output accordingly.


code_execution:
```python

import numpy as np

def find_connected_blocks(grid, color):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
    blocks = []

    def dfs(row, col, current_block):
        if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color:
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        current_block.append((row, col))
        dfs(row + 1, col, current_block)
        dfs(row - 1, col, current_block)
        dfs(row, col + 1, current_block)
        dfs(row, col - 1, current_block)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:
                current_block = []
                dfs(r, c, current_block)
                blocks.append(current_block)

    return blocks

def transform_grid(grid):
    azure_blocks = find_connected_blocks(grid, 8)
    output_grid = np.copy(grid)
    for block in azure_blocks:
        min_row = min(r for r, c in block)
        min_col = min(c for r, c in block)
        max_row = max(r for r, c in block)
        max_col = max(c for r, c in block)
        
        #Check for minimum size
        if (max_row - min_row +1 >=2) and (max_col - min_col + 1 >=2):
            output_grid[min_row, max_col] = 1

    return output_grid

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])


transformed_grid = transform_grid(working_grid)
print(f'{transformed_grid=}')

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
transformed_grid=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],
       [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

The `transform_grid` function has generated the predicted output grid which matches the `predicted_output` from the previous code execution.  Therefore, I will update the working output grid with this transformed grid.

function_call:
set_pixel (0,6,1)
set_pixel (1,1,1)
set_pixel (1,6,8)
set_pixel (3,4,1)
set_pixel (5,1,1)

result:
updated working output grid
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]


<start_of_image> Jupyter Notebook cell execution:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],
                      [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

print(f'{working_grid=}')


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
working_grid=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],
       [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

The working grid now accurately reflects the transformation.  All qualifying azure blocks have a blue pixel added to their top-right corner.
