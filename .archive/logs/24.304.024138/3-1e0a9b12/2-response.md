differences:
  cells_changed: 4
  colors_changed: The non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.  The maroon element moves to the far right of the bottom row.

transformation:
  - Similar to example_1, non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, preserving their relative positions.  The last element is placed at the far right.
```

The transformation in both examples involves moving all non-zero pixels to the bottom row while maintaining their relative order. The last non-zero pixel moves to the last position in the bottom row.  This appears to be a consistent pattern.
