## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

```
input:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (8)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: maroon
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

output:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (12)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

differences:
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid, with the same relative positioning to each other as the input.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).

transformation:
  - The transformation appears to involve collecting all non-zero colored pixels and moving them to the bottom row, starting from the left.  The relative positions of the colored pixels are preserved.
```

The transformation seems to be a consolidation of non-zero elements into the bottom row, maintaining their relative order.  I will look for this pattern in subsequent examples.

## observations:

```
input:
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: (28)
    - 4: (3)
    - 7: (2)
    - 8: (2)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,0), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,2), color: orange
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,2), color: orange
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,3), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (0,5), color: maroon

output:
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: (32)
    - 4: (3)
    - 7: (2)
    - 8: (2)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,0), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: orange
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,3), color: orange
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,4), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (5,5), color: maroon

differences:
  cells_changed: 4
  colors_changed: The non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.  The maroon element moves to the far right of the bottom row.

transformation:
  - Similar to example_1, non-zero elements are moved to the bottom row, preserving their relative positions.  The last element is placed at the far right.
```

The transformation in both examples involves moving all non-zero pixels to the bottom row while maintaining their relative order. The last non-zero pixel moves to the last position in the bottom row.  This appears to be a consistent pattern.

    - size: 1x1, position: (2,3), color: blue
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,4), color: red

output:
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: (22)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (1)
    - 3: (3)
    - 6: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: green
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,1), color: green
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: blue
    - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: red

differences:
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  Non-zero elements are moved to the bottom rows, preserving relative positions.  The magenta element moves to the bottom-left corner.

transformation:
  - The transformation is similar to previous examples but with a slight difference in the placement of elements in the bottom row.  The elements maintain their relative positions, but the placement strategy seems to involve filling the bottom rows from left to right, and then bottom-right.
```

The consistent pattern across all three examples is the movement of non-zero pixels to the bottom rows, maintaining their relative positions.  The difference lies in how the bottom row is filled: from left to right, prioritizing the bottom-left corner, and then the bottom-right corner if there are remaining elements. The specific placement might be influenced by the shape and size of the objects and the relative positions of their elements within the input grid.


# examples summary: 

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
