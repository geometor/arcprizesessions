Here's an analysis of example_1:

```
input:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (8)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: maroon
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

output:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (12)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

differences:
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid, with the same relative positioning to each other as the input.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).

transformation:
  - The transformation appears to involve collecting all non-zero colored pixels and moving them to the bottom row, starting from the left.  The relative positions of the colored pixels are preserved.
```

The transformation seems to be a consolidation of non-zero elements into the bottom row, maintaining their relative order.  I will look for this pattern in subsequent examples.
