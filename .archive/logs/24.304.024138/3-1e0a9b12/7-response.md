The initialized grid is correct.  It's a 5x5 grid filled with zeros, ready to receive the non-zero elements from the input grid.  Let's proceed to populate it based on the observed pattern.

function_call:
set_pixel

parameters:
x: 3
y: 0
color: 5

result:
set_pixel(x=3, y=0, color=5)

<start_of_image> Institutional Review Board (IRB) applications must include sufficient detail about the research study for the IRB to make a determination as to whether or not it is eligible for review.  However, IRB application processes vary.  When in doubt about the information required in your IRB application, contact your IRB office and inquire about what they require.  IRB applications are often used by institutions to determine eligibility for review, not whether a research study is ethical.  The IRB's decision as to whether or not a research study is eligible for review, based on the information submitted in the IRB application, is not necessarily the IRB's decision as to whether or not a study is ethical.
