# example_1

## input:

[[0 4 0 9]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 4 6 0]
 [1 0 0 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7553E9927280>


## output:

[[0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 4 0 0]
 [1 4 6 9]]

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

```
input:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (8)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: maroon
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

output:
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (12)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

differences:
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid, with the same relative positioning to each other as the input.  The rest of the grid is filled with white (0).

transformation:
  - The transformation appears to involve collecting all non-zero colored pixels and moving them to the bottom row, starting from the left.  The relative positions of the colored pixels are preserved.
```

The transformation seems to be a consolidation of non-zero elements into the bottom row, maintaining their relative order.  I will look for this pattern in subsequent examples.


# example_2

## input:

[[0 0 0 0 0 9]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [4 0 0 0 0 0]
 [4 0 7 8 0 0]
 [4 0 7 0 0 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7553EAF04F10>


## output:

[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [4 0 0 0 0 0]
 [4 0 7 8 0 0]
 [4 0 7 8 0 9]]

## observations:

- review the example grids

- check for differences and patterns
