differences:
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  Non-zero elements are moved to the bottom rows, preserving relative positions.  The magenta element moves to the bottom-left corner.

transformation:
  - The transformation is similar to previous examples but with a slight difference in the placement of elements in the bottom row.  The elements maintain their relative positions, but the placement strategy seems to involve filling the bottom rows from left to right, and then bottom-right.
```

The consistent pattern across all three examples is the movement of non-zero pixels to the bottom rows, maintaining their relative positions.  The difference lies in how the bottom row is filled: from left to right, prioritizing the bottom-left corner, and then the bottom-right corner if there are remaining elements. The specific placement might be influenced by the shape and size of the objects and the relative positions of their elements within the input grid.
