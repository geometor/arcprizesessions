Here's an analysis of example_4, incorporating previous findings:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of maroon, yellow, and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of azure, green, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Complete color remapping, preserving spatial arrangement.

**Transformation:**

Example 4 reinforces the color mapping pattern.  Let's update the `color_map`:


code_execution:
```python
color_map = {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2, 9:8, 4:3}
print(color_map)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
{2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2, 9: 8, 4: 3}
```

The `color_map` now encompasses all observed color mappings. The transformation rule remains consistent: "Replace each input color with its corresponding output color as defined in the `color_map`."  The mapping is deterministic but not based on a simple mathematical formula; it's essentially an arbitrary but consistent lookup table.

**Ruminate Phase:**

The examples strongly suggest a color remapping transformation.  The key to solving future grids is accurately determining the complete `color_map` based on the input examples.  The absence of a simple mathematical rule implies that the color relationships are arbitrary (though consistent).  Therefore, it is not sufficient to extrapolate color mappings based on a single example.  The solution requires using all example data provided. The spatial arrangement of colors remains constant.
