## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of green, blue and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of yellow, gray and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Each color in the input grid has been replaced by a different color in the output grid with a consistent mapping (3->4, 1->5, 2->6).  The new colors maintain the same spatial arrangement.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping. Each color in the input is replaced with a specific corresponding color in the output.  There's no change to the spatial arrangement or the shape of the color blocks.  This suggests a direct mapping rule:  `input_color + 1 -> output_color`.


To confirm, let's test if this mapping holds for additional examples (if any are provided) and whether this holds across the entire color range.  If other examples present new colours, I will adjust this transformation rule.
