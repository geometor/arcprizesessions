The initialized output grid is a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white).  This is appropriate as a starting point since the output grid's dimensions are the same as the input, but the colors are completely different.

Let's proceed with filling the output grid based on the predicted output derived from the `color_map`.

function_call:
set_range

result:
set_range(x1=0, y1=0, x2=2, y2=0, color=9)
# working output grid
updated with your changes
[[9 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]]
