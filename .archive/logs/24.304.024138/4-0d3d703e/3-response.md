Here's an analysis of example_3, integrating the findings from previous examples:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of gray, azure, and magenta.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of blue, maroon, and red.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Again, a complete color remapping with no change to spatial arrangement.


**Transformation:**

Example 3 confirms the pattern of a color mapping. Let's extend the color mapping dictionary:



code_execution:

```python

color_map = {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6:2}
print(color_map)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
{2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2}

```

The `color_map` now includes mappings observed across all three examples.  The transformation rule remains: "Replace each input color with its corresponding output color as defined by the `color_map`".  This rule is consistent and deterministic across the examples provided.  The `color_map` acts as the key to the transformation.  No simple arithmetic or geometric rule is sufficient to describe the transformation; the mapping is essentially arbitrary, but consistent within the provided examples.
