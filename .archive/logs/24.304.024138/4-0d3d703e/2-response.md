Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of red, green, and azure.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of magenta, yellow, and maroon.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Again, each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output. The spatial arrangement remains identical.


**Transformation:**

The transformation in example_2 further supports the hypothesis of a color mapping. Let's analyze the mappings:


*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta)
*   3 (green) -> 4 (yellow)
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon)

This mapping doesn't follow the simple "+1" rule observed in example_1. There isn't an immediately obvious mathematical relationship between the input and output colors. However, we can see there's a consistent and deterministic mapping of colors.  To represent the mapping better, let's use a dictionary.  The transformation involves replacing the colors based on the mapping specified in the dictionary below.




code_execution:

```python

color_map = {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}
print(color_map)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
{2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}

```

This dictionary shows the mapping between input and output colors.  This mapping is consistent.

To generalize the transformation rule:  A lookup table or a similar data structure to store the color mapping is required for a complete solution.  A simple arithmetic rule doesn't seem sufficient across different input color sets.  The rule is:  "Replace each input color with its corresponding output color as defined by the color mapping". The color mapping may need to be inferred from the example data or provided as part of the problem definition.
