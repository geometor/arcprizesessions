# example_1

## input:

[[3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553E99DBDF0>


## output:

[[4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EC092D10>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of green, blue and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of yellow, gray and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Each color in the input grid has been replaced by a different color in the output grid with a consistent mapping (3->4, 1->5, 2->6).  The new colors maintain the same spatial arrangement.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping. Each color in the input is replaced with a specific corresponding color in the output.  There's no change to the spatial arrangement or the shape of the color blocks.  This suggests a direct mapping rule:  `input_color + 1 -> output_color`.


To confirm, let's test if this mapping holds for additional examples (if any are provided) and whether this holds across the entire color range.  If other examples present new colours, I will adjust this transformation rule.



# example_2

[[2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EAF04F10>


## output:

[[6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553E99DB0A0>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of red, green, and azure.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of magenta, yellow, and maroon.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: Again, each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output. The spatial arrangement remains identical.


**Transformation:**

The transformation in example_2 further supports the hypothesis of a color mapping. Let's analyze the mappings:


*   2 (red) -> 6 (magenta)
*   3 (green) -> 4 (yellow)
*   8 (azure) -> 9 (maroon)

This mapping doesn't follow the simple "+1" rule observed in example_1. There isn't an immediately obvious mathematical relationship between the input and output colors. However, we can see there's a consistent and deterministic mapping of colors.  To represent the mapping better, let's use a dictionary.  The transformation involves replacing the colors based on the mapping specified in the dictionary below.




code_execution:

```python

color_map = {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}
print(color_map)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
{2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}

```

This dictionary shows the mapping between input and output colors.  This mapping is consistent.

To generalize the transformation rule:  A lookup table or a similar data structure to store the color mapping is required for a complete solution.  A simple arithmetic rule doesn't seem sufficient across different input color sets.  The rule is:  "Replace each input color with its corresponding output color as defined by the color mapping". The color mapping may need to be inferred from the example data or provided as part of the problem definition.


# example_3

## input:

[[5 8 6]
 [5 8 6]
 [5 8 6]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EAF05630>


## output:

[[1 9 2]
 [1 9 2]
 [1 9 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553E99DBE50>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, integrating the findings from previous examples:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of gray, azure, and magenta.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of blue, maroon, and red.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Again, a complete color remapping with no change to spatial arrangement.


**Transformation:**

Example 3 confirms the pattern of a color mapping. Let's extend the color mapping dictionary:



code_execution:

```python

color_map = {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6:2}
print(color_map)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
{2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2}

```

The `color_map` now includes mappings observed across all three examples.  The transformation rule remains: "Replace each input color with its corresponding output color as defined by the `color_map`".  This rule is consistent and deterministic across the examples provided.  The `color_map` acts as the key to the transformation.  No simple arithmetic or geometric rule is sufficient to describe the transformation; the mapping is essentially arbitrary, but consistent within the provided examples.


# example_4

## input:

[[9 4 2]
 [9 4 2]
 [9 4 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EAE0ED10>


## output:

[[8 3 6]
 [8 3 6]
 [8 3 6]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7553EAE0EB60>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_4, incorporating previous findings:

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of maroon, yellow, and red.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x3 rectangles of azure, green, and magenta.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed:  Complete color remapping, preserving spatial arrangement.

**Transformation:**

Example 4 reinforces the color mapping pattern.  Let's update the `color_map`:


code_execution:
```python
color_map = {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2, 9:8, 4:3}
print(color_map)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
{2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2, 9: 8, 4: 3}
```

The `color_map` now encompasses all observed color mappings. The transformation rule remains consistent: "Replace each input color with its corresponding output color as defined in the `color_map`."  The mapping is deterministic but not based on a simple mathematical formula; it's essentially an arbitrary but consistent lookup table.

**Ruminate Phase:**

The examples strongly suggest a color remapping transformation.  The key to solving future grids is accurately determining the complete `color_map` based on the input examples.  The absence of a simple mathematical rule implies that the color relationships are arbitrary (though consistent).  Therefore, it is not sufficient to extrapolate color mappings based on a single example.  The solution requires using all example data provided. The spatial arrangement of colors remains constant.
