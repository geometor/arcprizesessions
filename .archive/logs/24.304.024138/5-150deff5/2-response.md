**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 10
height: 8
colors:
  - 0: 62
  - 5: 18
objects:
  - A single, roughly heart-shaped blob of gray (5) pixels.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 10
height: 8
colors:
  - 0: 62
  - 8: 8
  - 2: 10
objects:
  - A single, roughly heart-shaped blob of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 18
colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by azure (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining a similar shape.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation in Example 2 mirrors that of Example 1.  The gray (5) blob is replaced by an azure (8) and red (2) blob, preserving the original shape.  The pattern of color replacement, however, remains unclear.  The replacement isn't a simple alternating pattern or a consistent ratio of azure to red.


**Synthesis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples demonstrate a consistent transformation:

1. **Identify the main gray (5) blob.**  The blob's shape is irregular but contiguous.
2. **Preserve the blob's shape.** The new blob occupies the same space.
3. **Replace gray (5) with azure (8) and red (2).** The specific pattern of replacement remains undetermined, requiring more examples.  It's not a simple rule like "alternate colors" or "a fixed ratio".  The arrangement of azure and red within the blob might be more complex, potentially related to the internal structure of the original gray blob.


**Hypothesis:**

The algorithm likely involves a process of:

1. **Blob identification:** Identifying the connected component of gray pixels.
2. **Shape preservation:**  The outline of the blob is maintained.
3. **Color replacement:**  A more sophisticated rule than a simple alternating pattern is applied to replace the gray pixels with a combination of azure and red.  The rule likely involves looking at the neighborhood of each gray pixel within the blob, or possibly analyzing the overall shape of the blob to determine a replacement pattern.


More examples are crucial to determine the precise rule governing the replacement of gray pixels with azure and red.
