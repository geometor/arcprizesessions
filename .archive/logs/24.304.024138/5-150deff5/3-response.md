**Example 3**

**Input:**

```
width: 9
height: 8
colors:
  - 0: 62
  - 5: 14
objects:
  - A single, somewhat irregular blob of gray (5) pixels.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 9
height: 8
colors:
  - 0: 62
  - 2: 6
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - A single, somewhat irregular blob of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 14
colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by red (2) and azure (8) pixels. The shape is largely preserved.
```

**Transformation:**

Example 3 reinforces the pattern observed in the previous examples.  The gray blob is replaced by a blob of red and azure, maintaining the original shape.

**Synthesis of all three examples:**

Across all three examples, the core transformation remains consistent:

1. **Identify the connected component of gray (5) pixels.** This forms the central object.
2. **Maintain the shape and size of the object.** The transformed object occupies the same spatial extent.
3. **Replace the gray pixels (5) with a mixture of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.**  The specific pattern of replacement isn't directly deducible from these three examples. It's not simply an alternating pattern or a fixed ratio.  The complexity suggests a more nuanced rule, potentially based on the neighborhood of each gray pixel or the overall shape of the gray blob.

**Further investigation:**

To determine the precise rule for color replacement, more examples are needed, varying the shape and size of the gray blob.  Observing how the red and azure pixels are arranged in the transformed blob for diverse input shapes would be critical to crack the code.  The complexity hints at a potential rule that goes beyond basic positional relationships, possibly involving more sophisticated pattern recognition or adjacency analysis.  The next steps should be to look at several more varied examples to see how they modify the placement of red and azure pixels and if there's a more general pattern.
