Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 11
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: 78
  - 5: 16
objects:
  - A single, irregular blob of gray (5) pixels.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 11
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: 78
  - 8: 6
  - 2: 10
objects:
  - A single, irregular blob of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 16
colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The arrangement is similar, but not identical.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray (5) blob with a similar-shaped blob composed of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The exact replacement pattern isn't immediately obvious; it's not simply a one-to-one mapping of gray pixels to either azure or red.  Further examples are needed to solidify the rules of transformation.  The core pattern seems to be a "color-shift" of the central object with some internal change in color arrangement.

**Next Steps:**

To better understand the transformation, I need more examples.  I hypothesize that the transformation rules might involve:

1. **Object identification:**  Identifying the main blob of gray pixels.
2. **Shape preservation:** Maintaining the overall shape and size of the blob.
3. **Color replacement:** Replacing gray (5) with a combination of azure (8) and red (2), following a yet-to-be-determined pattern.

More examples will help define the specifics of this replacement pattern.
