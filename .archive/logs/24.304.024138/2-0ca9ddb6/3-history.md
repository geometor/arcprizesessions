## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation rules:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; forming crosses around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve the addition of new colored pixels around existing colored pixels. Specifically:

*   A red pixel spawns a yellow cross pattern around itself.
*   A blue pixel spawns an orange cross pattern around itself.

The cross pattern consists of four pixels forming a "+" shape around the original pixel.  The cross does not overwrite existing pixels; it simply adds new colored pixels around the original.


**Next Steps:**

To confirm this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Additional examples will help determine if this pattern holds for other colors and object configurations, and reveal if there are other aspects to the transformation rule (e.g., the size of the crosses, the distances between the original pixel and the added ones, etc.).

## observations:

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (67)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,3) and (6,6)


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (53)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,3) and (6,6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels around the red pixel at (7,1)
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels forming crosses around blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1.  Red pixels spawn yellow crosses, and blue pixels spawn orange crosses. The azure pixel remains unchanged.


**Summary of Transformation Rules (Based on Two Examples):**

1.  **Identify Colored Pixels:** The algorithm identifies all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Spawn Crosses:** For each identified pixel:
    *   If the pixel is red (2), a yellow (4) cross is added around it.
    *   If the pixel is blue (1), an orange (7) cross is added around it.
3.  **No Overwriting:** The new pixels are added without overwriting existing pixels.  The crosses are centered on the original pixel.


**Next Steps:**

More examples are needed to test the robustness of these rules.  We need to check:

*   What happens if multiple colored pixels are adjacent or overlapping?
*   Does this rule apply to all colors or just red and blue?
*   Are there any other colors that trigger their own unique cross patterns?
*   What is the size of the cross? (always 4 cells)


Testing with more examples will allow us to refine and solidify these transformation rules.
