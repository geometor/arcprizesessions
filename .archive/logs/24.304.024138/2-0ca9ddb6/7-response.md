The `initialize_output_from_input` function correctly copied the input grid to the working output grid.  This is a good starting point because the transformation primarily adds to the existing grid rather than replacing elements.

Let's verify that the working output grid accurately reflects the input:

code_execution:
```python
working_output = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

import numpy as np

working_output_np = np.array(working_output)
print(f"Unique values in working output: {np.unique(working_output_np)}")
print(f"Shape of working output: {working_output_np.shape}")
```

code_execution_result: 3
```
Unique values in working output: [0 1 2 6 8]
Shape of working output: (9, 9)
```

The code confirms that the working output grid has the correct shape (9x9) and contains the expected unique values (0, 1, 2, 6, 8) from the input grid.  Everything looks consistent with the established transformation rules.  We are ready to proceed with adding the crosses.
