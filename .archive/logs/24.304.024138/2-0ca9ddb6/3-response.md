**Example 3:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   Single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (2, 2)
    *   Single magenta (6) pixel at (5, 6)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (7, 3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red and blue pixels respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation in Example 3 further reinforces the pattern observed in Examples 1 and 2.  Red pixels generate yellow crosses, and blue pixels generate orange crosses. The magenta pixel remains unchanged.  This suggests that the rule is consistent across different color combinations and positions.


**Summary of Refined Transformation Rules (Based on Three Examples):**

1.  **Identify Colored Pixels:**  The algorithm identifies all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Spawn Crosses:** For each identified pixel:
    *   If the pixel is red (2), a yellow (4) cross is added around it.
    *   If the pixel is blue (1), an orange (7) cross is added around it.
3.  **No Overwriting:** New pixels are added without overwriting existing pixels.
4.  **Cross Size:** The crosses are always 4 pixels in size, forming a "+" shape centered on the original pixel.
5.  **Other Colors:** Other colors (like magenta in Example 3) are not affected by this transformation.

The consistency across these three examples provides strong evidence supporting these transformation rules.  However, additional examples are still beneficial to further validate these observations and potentially identify edge cases or exceptions.
