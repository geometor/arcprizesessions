**Example 2:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (67)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,3) and (6,6)


**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (53)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (8)
    *   8: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single azure (8) pixel at (3, 0)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,1)
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,3) and (6,6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels around the red pixel at (7,1)
    *   Eight orange (7) pixels forming crosses around blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 16
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around red and blue pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with Example 1.  Red pixels spawn yellow crosses, and blue pixels spawn orange crosses. The azure pixel remains unchanged.


**Summary of Transformation Rules (Based on Two Examples):**

1.  **Identify Colored Pixels:** The algorithm identifies all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Spawn Crosses:** For each identified pixel:
    *   If the pixel is red (2), a yellow (4) cross is added around it.
    *   If the pixel is blue (1), an orange (7) cross is added around it.
3.  **No Overwriting:** The new pixels are added without overwriting existing pixels.  The crosses are centered on the original pixel.


**Next Steps:**

More examples are needed to test the robustness of these rules.  We need to check:

*   What happens if multiple colored pixels are adjacent or overlapping?
*   Does this rule apply to all colors or just red and blue?
*   Are there any other colors that trigger their own unique cross patterns?
*   What is the size of the cross? (always 4 cells)


Testing with more examples will allow us to refine and solidify these transformation rules.
