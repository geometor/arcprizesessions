## observations:

Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation rules:

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   objects:
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (64)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   objects:
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (3, 2)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (6, 6)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red pixel.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a cross around the blue pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 8
*   colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels; forming crosses around the existing red and blue pixels respectively.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve the addition of new colored pixels around existing colored pixels. Specifically:

*   A red pixel spawns a yellow cross pattern around itself.
*   A blue pixel spawns an orange cross pattern around itself.

The cross pattern consists of four pixels forming a "+" shape around the original pixel.  The cross does not overwrite existing pixels; it simply adds new colored pixels around the original.


**Next Steps:**

To confirm this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Additional examples will help determine if this pattern holds for other colors and object configurations, and reveal if there are other aspects to the transformation rule (e.g., the size of the crosses, the distances between the original pixel and the added ones, etc.).
