## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 11
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:** 
    *   0: (many)
    *   5: (17)
*   **objects:** A single, irregularly shaped blob of gray (5) pixels.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 11
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (many)
    *   2: (7)
    *   8: (17)
*   **objects:** A single, irregularly shaped blob of azure (8) pixels, with a smaller, adjacent blob of red (2) pixels.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 24
*   **colors_changed:** Gray (5) pixels are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The shapes are similar, but not identical.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve replacing the gray (5) pixels with other colors while maintaining a similar shape.  The gray blob is replaced with a larger azure blob. Inside the azure blob a red area is formed. The new area is partially overlapping with the original gray blob. Specifically,  the gray pixels seem to be replaced according to a pattern that creates a new shape using azure and red.  More examples are needed to solidify this hypothesis, but the overall pattern is a replacement with a similar shape,  a "recoloring" of the gray pixels, based on the original shape.

To confirm the hypothesis, more examples are necessary to establish whether the rule is consistent and to define precisely how the replacement of colors occurs.  For example, does the size and position of the grey blob affect the resulting distribution of red and azure? What happens when there are multiple blobs of gray?

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, comparing it to example_1 and refining the transformation hypothesis:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 10
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (many)
    *   5: (22)
*   **objects:** A single, roughly heart-shaped blob of gray (5) pixels.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 10
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (many)
    *   2: (8)
    *   8: (14)
*   **objects:**  A single, roughly heart-shaped blob composed of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The shape is similar to the input's gray blob.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 22
*   **colors_changed:** All gray (5) pixels are replaced by azure (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining the original shape.


**Transformation (refined hypothesis):**

Example 2 strongly supports the hypothesis from example 1.  The transformation again involves a "recoloring" of a gray (5) blob.  The shape of the gray blob remains largely unchanged.  The gray pixels are consistently replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  However, we can observe a pattern: the color replacement seems to follow a kind of 'border' effect.  The outer layer of the blob is mostly Azure, and the interior becomes red, or a mix of both.

**Comparison with Example 1:**

Both examples show a consistent transformation:  a gray (5) blob is recolored into a similar-shaped blob using azure (8) and red (2).  The distribution of azure and red within the new blob seems to depend on the shape's geometry (possibly a "border effect" or filling from the exterior inwards).

**Further investigation needed:**

*   More examples are crucial to definitively confirm the "border" effect and determine exactly how azure and red are distributed within the transformed blob (e.g., does the blob's density affect the ratio of colors?).
*   Test cases with multiple, disconnected gray blobs are needed to observe whether the transformation applies independently to each blob or introduces interactions between them.
*   Test cases with different shapes and sizes of gray blobs will help refine the rules of the transformation.

The current hypothesis is:

1.  Identify all pixels with value 5 (grey).
2.  Retain the shape of the blob composed of grey pixels.
3.  Replace pixels on the exterior of the shape with value 8 (azure).
4.  Replace pixels on the interior of the shape with value 2 (red).

This "border effect" hypothesis needs further testing.
