Here's an analysis of example_3, further refining the transformation hypothesis:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (many)
    *   5: (16)
*   **objects:** A single, somewhat irregular blob of gray (5) pixels.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 8
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (many)
    *   2: (6)
    *   8: (10)
*   **objects:** A single blob, similar in shape to the input's gray blob, but recolored using azure (8) and red (2).


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 16
*   **colors_changed:** All gray (5) pixels are replaced with azure (8) and red (2), maintaining the original shape.


**Transformation (further refined hypothesis):**

Example 3 further strengthens the hypothesis that gray (5) blobs are recolored into azure (8) and red (2) blobs, retaining the original shape.  The distribution of colors within the new blob continues to suggest an "outside-in" pattern. The outer layer of the blob is preferentially changed to azure (8), followed by the inner layers being changed to red (2).  There's no clear, strict definition of "outer" and "inner", based on these examples. There may be a distance to the center of the blob, or another related metric determining the transformation.

**Comparison with previous examples:**

All three examples consistently demonstrate the replacement of gray (5) blobs with azure (8) and red (2) blobs, preserving the original shape.  The "outside-in" recoloring pattern persists across examples.  The relative proportions of red and azure seem to depend on the blob's shape and size (this also needs more examples to be sure).  The core transformation remains consistent: grey blobs become a mix of blue and red blobs keeping the original shape.


**Further investigation needed:**

*   More examples are needed to definitively determine the rules governing the distribution of azure (8) and red (2) within the transformed blob.  Precise metrics (like distance from the centroid) should be tested to see if they correlate with the color assignment.
*   Examples with multiple, disconnected gray blobs, and various shapes and sizes are still required for comprehensive testing.


The current, refined hypothesis is:

1.  Identify all pixels with value 5 (grey).
2.  Retain the shape of the blob composed of grey pixels.
3.  Prioritize replacing pixels at the perimeter of the blob with value 8 (azure).
4.  Subsequently replace pixels closer to the center of the blob with value 2 (red).

The 'perimeter' and 'center' are not mathematically defined here, only visually suggested.  Further exploration is needed to define these aspects precisely.  The distribution of red and azure may be non-deterministic; it may depend on the original shape or it may be random within the described process.
