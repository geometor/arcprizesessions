The working output grid has been correctly initialized to a blank grid of the correct size (11x8) filled with 0s (white).  This is appropriate since the output is largely different from the input.  The next steps will involve iteratively applying the transformation rules inferred from the examples.  The code from the previous step is helpful for identifying the blobs.

Let's proceed with applying the color changes iteratively, guided by the "outside-in" perimeter hypothesis.  We will start with the largest blob, focusing on the perimeter first and then moving inwards.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

labeled_array, num_features = label(test_input)

blobs = []
for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
    blob = np.where(labeled_array == label_num)
    blobs.append(list(zip(blob[0], blob[1])))

working_output = np.zeros((8, 11), dtype=int)

#Process Blob 1
for row, col in blobs[0]:
    working_output[row, col] = 8  #Initialize all to azure

#Process Blob 2
for row, col in blobs[1]:
    working_output[row, col] = 8

print(working_output)
