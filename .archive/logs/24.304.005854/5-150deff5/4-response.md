The transformation consistently involves recolored gray (5) blobs into a combination of azure (8) and red (2), preserving the original shape.  The color replacement follows an "outside-in" pattern, with the outer regions preferentially becoming azure and inner regions becoming red.  However, a precise mathematical definition of "outer" and "inner" regions, and the exact rules governing color distribution, remain unclear.  The examples suggest a correlation between the blob's shape and the resulting azure/red ratio, but more data is needed to confirm this hypothesis.  The transformation appears deterministic in that the shape is preserved, but the internal color distribution might be stochastic.

Let's use code to analyze the properties of the gray blobs in more detail:

def count_perimeter_pixels(arr):
    rows, cols = arr.shape
    perimeter_count = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if arr[i, j] == 5:
                if i == 0 or i == rows - 1 or j == 0 or j == cols - 1 or (arr[i-1,j] == 0 or arr[i+1, j] == 0 or arr[i, j-1] == 0 or arr[i, j+1] == 0):

print(f"Example 1 perimeter pixels: {count_perimeter_pixels(example_1_input)}")
print(f"Example 2 perimeter pixels: {count_perimeter_pixels(example_2_input)}")
print(f"Example 3 perimeter pixels: {count_perimeter_pixels(example_3_input)}")


```

```
Example 1 perimeter pixels: 19
Example 2 perimeter pixels: 20
Example 3 perimeter pixels: 14

```

The code counts the number of perimeter pixels in each example's input gray blob.  The results show some variation in the perimeter-to-total-area ratio, which could explain the differences in the azure/red distribution in the outputs.  This supports the hypothesis that the transformation's stochasticity depends on the blob's shape and size.  A more sophisticated analysis could involve calculating the centroid of each blob and then measuring the distance of each pixel from the centroid to refine the "outside-in" model.  Further exploration could also include analyzing the connected components to handle multiple, independent gray blobs.
