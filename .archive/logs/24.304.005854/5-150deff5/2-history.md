## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 11
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:** 
    *   0: (many)
    *   5: (17)
*   **objects:** A single, irregularly shaped blob of gray (5) pixels.


**Output:**

*   **width:** 11
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (many)
    *   2: (7)
    *   8: (17)
*   **objects:** A single, irregularly shaped blob of azure (8) pixels, with a smaller, adjacent blob of red (2) pixels.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 24
*   **colors_changed:** Gray (5) pixels are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The shapes are similar, but not identical.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve replacing the gray (5) pixels with other colors while maintaining a similar shape.  The gray blob is replaced with a larger azure blob. Inside the azure blob a red area is formed. The new area is partially overlapping with the original gray blob. Specifically,  the gray pixels seem to be replaced according to a pattern that creates a new shape using azure and red.  More examples are needed to solidify this hypothesis, but the overall pattern is a replacement with a similar shape,  a "recoloring" of the gray pixels, based on the original shape.

To confirm the hypothesis, more examples are necessary to establish whether the rule is consistent and to define precisely how the replacement of colors occurs.  For example, does the size and position of the grey blob affect the resulting distribution of red and azure? What happens when there are multiple blobs of gray?
