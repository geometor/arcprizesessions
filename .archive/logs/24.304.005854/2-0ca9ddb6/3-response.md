Here's an analysis of example_3, comparing the input and output grids:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   6: (1)
*   **objects:**
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (2,2)
    *   Single magenta (6) pixel at (5,6)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (7,3)

**Output:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (65)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   6: (1)
    *   7: (4)
*   **objects:**
    *   Single red (2) pixel at (2,2)
    *   Single magenta (6) pixel at (5,6)
    *   Single blue (1) pixel at (7,3)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels surrounding the red (2) pixel in a cross pattern.
    *   Four orange (7) pixels surrounding the blue (1) pixel in a cross pattern.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 8
*   **colors_changed:** Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red (2) and blue (1) pixels respectively.


**Transformation:**

The transformation in example 3 is consistent with the pattern observed in examples 1 and 2.  Yellow (4) pixels are added around red (2) pixels, and orange (7) pixels are added around blue (1) pixels.  The pattern of addition is a cross around the central pixel in each case.  The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.


**Overall Hypothesis Refinement:**

The hypothesis is further strengthened by example 3.  The rule appears to be:

1.  Identify all red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each red (2) pixel, add four yellow (4) pixels in a cross pattern around it (directly above, below, left, and right).
3.  For each blue (1) pixel, add four orange (7) pixels in a cross pattern around it.
4.  All other pixels remain unchanged.


This rule accurately predicts the output for all three examples provided.  Further testing with additional examples is recommended to confirm the robustness of this hypothesis.
