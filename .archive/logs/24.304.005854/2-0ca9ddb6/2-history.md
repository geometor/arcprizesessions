## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1, comparing the input and output grids:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (73)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
*   **objects:**
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6,6)
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3,2)

**Output:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (61)
    *   1: (1)
    *   2: (1)
    *   4: (4)
    *   7: (4)
*   **objects:**
    *   A single blue (1) pixel at (6,6)
    *   A single red (2) pixel at (3,2)
    *   Four yellow (4) pixels forming a cross around the red (2)
    *   Four orange (7) pixels forming a square around the blue (1) pixel


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 8
*   **colors_changed:** Added yellow (4) and orange (7) colors.  The existing red (2) and blue (1) pixels remain in the same positions.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding new colored pixels around existing pixels:

*   The red (2) pixel at (3,2) is surrounded by yellow (4) pixels forming a cross pattern.
*   The blue (1) pixel at (6,6) is surrounded by orange (7) pixels forming a 2x2 square.

The pattern is not immediately clear.  It's possible there's some hidden spatial relationship between the original pixels and the newly added ones.  The cross and square patterns might be clues to a more general rule.  More examples are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis.
