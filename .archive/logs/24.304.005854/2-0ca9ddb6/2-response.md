Here's an analysis of example_2, comparing the input and output grids:

**Input:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (71)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   8: (1)
*   **objects:**
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,2) and (6,6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,0)
    *   One azure (8) pixel at (0,3)


**Output:**

*   **width:** 9
*   **height:** 9
*   **colors:**
    *   0: (57)
    *   1: (2)
    *   2: (2)
    *   4: (8)
    *   7: (10)
    *   8: (1)
*   **objects:**
    *   Two blue (1) pixels at (3,2) and (6,6)
    *   Two red (2) pixels at (2,6) and (7,0)
    *   One azure (8) pixel at (0,3)
    *   Eight yellow (4) pixels surrounding red and blue pixels.
    *   Ten orange (7) pixels surrounding red and blue pixels.


**Differences:**

*   **cells_changed:** 18
*   **colors_changed:** Added yellow (4) and orange (7) colors around existing colored pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is similar to example 1, but with a more complex arrangement of the added pixels:

*   Yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels appear around both the red (2) and blue (1) pixels. The arrangement of these new pixels is not uniform; sometimes they form a cross or square, sometimes it's a larger shape.

**Comparison with Example 1:**

Both examples show the addition of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around existing pixels. The specific pattern of the added pixels seems to depend on the position and type of the existing colored pixel. The general principle seems to be a form of spatial expansion/surrounding of the existing non-white pixels.

**Overall Hypothesis:**

Based on these two examples, I hypothesize that the transformation rule involves identifying non-white pixels in the input grid.  Then, based on the location and type of those pixels, add yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels to the output grid surrounding the identified pixels.  The specific pattern (cross, square, or irregular shape) of the added pixels might depend on local grid conditions or the type of the surrounded pixel (red vs. blue). More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.
