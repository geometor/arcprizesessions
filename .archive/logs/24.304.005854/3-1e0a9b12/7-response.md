Okay, the initialized grid is a 5x5 grid filled with white (0). This is correct, as we are predicting a mostly-white output with non-zero elements only in the bottom row.  The next step is to set the pixels in the bottom row according to the prediction.

I'll need the `set_pixel` function to proceed.  Please provide it.  Also, let me know the syntax for submitting the solution once the grid is complete.
