Here's an analysis of example_3, following the same format as the previous examples:

**input:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 19
    - 1: 2
    - 3: 3
    - 2: 1
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (0,3), (2,3)
    - green (3): (1,1), (2,1), (4,1)
    - red (2): (2,4)
    - magenta (6): (3,0)

**output:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 20
    - 1: 2
    - 3: 3
    - 2: 1
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (4,3), (4,2)
    - green (3): (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)
    - red (2): (4,4)
    - magenta (6): (4,0)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: Non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom row, maintaining relative positions where possible. Some rearrangement within the bottom row also occurs. The magenta (6) moves to bottom left, while the green (3) occupies the second and third columns.

**transformation:**
- Similar to the previous examples, the transformation involves moving non-white colored cells towards the bottom row of the grid.  However, there is more rearrangement in the bottom row to accommodate all the existing objects. The transformation doesn't necessarily preserve the original order strictly, it is a sort of compaction to the bottom row, but does not necessarily fill the entire row.

**Overall Pattern Synthesis:**

Across all three examples, the consistent theme is the movement of non-white colored cells to the bottom row, while maintaining their relative proximity as much as possible.  The bottom row may not always be completely filled; the number of cells filled seems dependent on the original number of non-zero cells in the input. There's a tendency to prioritize moving existing objects to the bottom row rather than filling the empty spaces. The order is not strictly preserved from the input, but the relative proximity is.
