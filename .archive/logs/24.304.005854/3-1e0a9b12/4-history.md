## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 11
    - 4: 2
    - 9: 1
    - 6: 1
    - 1: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (0,1), (2,1)
    - maroon (9): (0,3)
    - pink (6): (2,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)

**output:**
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 12
    - 4: 2
    - 9: 1
    - 6: 1
    - 1: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (2,1), (3,1)
    - maroon (9): (3,3)
    - pink (6): (3,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  The non-zero colored objects from the input are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, while the rest of the cells are set to white(0).

**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to involve moving the non-white colored cells to the bottom-right corner of the grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another.  The remaining cells become white.  The order of the colors in the bottom row seems to be important (blue, yellow, pink, maroon).  It's not simply a compaction, as some cells remain white.


I need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.  Specifically, I'd like to see if the bottom-right corner placement is consistent, or if there are variations based on the number and arrangement of non-zero colors in the input.  I also need to understand whether the order of the colors in the bottom row is significant or arbitrary.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 29
    - 9: 1
    - 8: 2
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
  objects:
    - maroon (9): (0,5)
    - azure (8): (1,3), (4,3)
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)

**output:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 30
    - 9: 1
    - 8: 2
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
  objects:
    - maroon (9): (5,5)
    - azure (8): (4,3), (5,3)
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 4
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.  The maroon(9) moves from top right to bottom right. The azure (8) moves down one row.

**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, non-white cells are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions. However, unlike example 1, it doesn't fill the entire bottom row.  The transformation seems to prioritize moving the existing non-white cells to the bottom row, without necessarily filling all available spaces in that row.


**Comparison of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a pattern of moving non-white cells to the bottom row while preserving their relative positions.  The key difference is that Example 1 fills the entire bottom row while Example 2 does not;  it only moves the existing cells to the bottom row.  The order of the colors in the bottom row is maintained, at least in this small sample. This suggests that the algorithm prioritizes moving the existing elements to the bottom, and there may be some limit on how many cells can be moved in the bottom row.  More examples are needed to test this.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, following the same format as the previous examples:

**input:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 19
    - 1: 2
    - 3: 3
    - 2: 1
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (0,3), (2,3)
    - green (3): (1,1), (2,1), (4,1)
    - red (2): (2,4)
    - magenta (6): (3,0)

**output:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 20
    - 1: 2
    - 3: 3
    - 2: 1
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (4,3), (4,2)
    - green (3): (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)
    - red (2): (4,4)
    - magenta (6): (4,0)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: Non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom row, maintaining relative positions where possible. Some rearrangement within the bottom row also occurs. The magenta (6) moves to bottom left, while the green (3) occupies the second and third columns.

**transformation:**
- Similar to the previous examples, the transformation involves moving non-white colored cells towards the bottom row of the grid.  However, there is more rearrangement in the bottom row to accommodate all the existing objects. The transformation doesn't necessarily preserve the original order strictly, it is a sort of compaction to the bottom row, but does not necessarily fill the entire row.

**Overall Pattern Synthesis:**

Across all three examples, the consistent theme is the movement of non-white colored cells to the bottom row, while maintaining their relative proximity as much as possible.  The bottom row may not always be completely filled; the number of cells filled seems dependent on the original number of non-zero cells in the input. There's a tendency to prioritize moving existing objects to the bottom row rather than filling the empty spaces. The order is not strictly preserved from the input, but the relative proximity is.
