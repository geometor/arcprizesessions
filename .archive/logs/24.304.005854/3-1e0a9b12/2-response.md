Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**input:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 29
    - 9: 1
    - 8: 2
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
  objects:
    - maroon (9): (0,5)
    - azure (8): (1,3), (4,3)
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)

**output:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 30
    - 9: 1
    - 8: 2
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
  objects:
    - maroon (9): (5,5)
    - azure (8): (4,3), (5,3)
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 4
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.  The maroon(9) moves from top right to bottom right. The azure (8) moves down one row.

**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, non-white cells are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions. However, unlike example 1, it doesn't fill the entire bottom row.  The transformation seems to prioritize moving the existing non-white cells to the bottom row, without necessarily filling all available spaces in that row.


**Comparison of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a pattern of moving non-white cells to the bottom row while preserving their relative positions.  The key difference is that Example 1 fills the entire bottom row while Example 2 does not;  it only moves the existing cells to the bottom row.  The order of the colors in the bottom row is maintained, at least in this small sample. This suggests that the algorithm prioritizes moving the existing elements to the bottom, and there may be some limit on how many cells can be moved in the bottom row.  More examples are needed to test this.
