## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 11
    - 4: 2
    - 9: 1
    - 6: 1
    - 1: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (0,1), (2,1)
    - maroon (9): (0,3)
    - pink (6): (2,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)

**output:**
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: 12
    - 4: 2
    - 9: 1
    - 6: 1
    - 1: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (2,1), (3,1)
    - maroon (9): (3,3)
    - pink (6): (3,2)
    - blue (1): (3,0)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  The non-zero colored objects from the input are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, while the rest of the cells are set to white(0).

**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to involve moving the non-white colored cells to the bottom-right corner of the grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another.  The remaining cells become white.  The order of the colors in the bottom row seems to be important (blue, yellow, pink, maroon).  It's not simply a compaction, as some cells remain white.


I need more examples to confirm or refine this hypothesis.  Specifically, I'd like to see if the bottom-right corner placement is consistent, or if there are variations based on the number and arrangement of non-zero colors in the input.  I also need to understand whether the order of the colors in the bottom row is significant or arbitrary.
