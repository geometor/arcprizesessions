# example_1

## input:

[[1 0 0 5 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 5 1 1 1]
 [1 0 0 5 0 0 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x750B4104DE70>


## output:

[[0 0 0]
 [0 2 0]
 [0 0 0]]

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (6)
    *   `0: white` (10)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`: A central column of three gray pixels, surrounded by blue and white pixels. The blue pixels appear to outline the gray column.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (8)
    *   `2: red` (1)
*   `objects`: A single red pixel in the center.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: 21 cells changed entirely.
*   `colors_changed`:  The input contains blue, white, and gray; while the output only uses white and red. The significant reduction in size suggests an aggregation or summary operation, rather than a direct mapping.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a reduction of the input image followed by a change of color in the central pixel. The original blue and white surrounding the center are discarded. The gray color is replaced by red.  The reduced size suggests a summarization or extraction of a key feature from the input.  The location of the red pixel corresponds to the central column of gray pixels.  It might be helpful to test more examples to see if this is a general pattern (e.g., if other colors get summarized similarly).


I need more examples to confirm the transformation rule.  Specifically, I'd like to see what happens with different input sizes, different central colors and different configurations of the surrounding pixels.


# example_2

## input:

[[1 1 0 5 0 1 0]
 [0 0 1 5 1 1 1]
 [1 1 0 5 0 1 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x750B42286B60>


## output:

[[0 2 0]
 [0 0 2]
 [0 2 0]]

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building on the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (8)
    *   `0: white` (9)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`:  Similar to example 1, a central column of gray pixels. However, the blue pixels are more distributed around the gray column than in example 1.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (6)
    *   `2: red` (3)
*   `objects`: Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern, with one red pixel in the center and one red pixel in each adjacent row.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: All cells are changed.
*   `colors_changed`: Similar to example 1, the input colors are simplified and reduced to white and red.


**Transformation:**

Example 2 strengthens the hypothesis that the transformation involves:

1.  **Reduction:** The input image is reduced in size.
2.  **Color change:** The central column of gray pixels is replaced with red pixels.
3.  **Pattern change:**  The pattern of red pixels in the output depends on the arrangement of blue pixels in the input, expanding on the idea of aggregation.  In example 1 the gray pixels were surrounded by blue, resulting in a single red pixel. In example 2, blue pixels are dispersed around the central gray column, resulting in a cross pattern of red pixels.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation appears to be a form of feature extraction and representation.  The central column of gray is important, and its final color will be red. The pattern of red in the output is a function of the distribution of blue in the input around that column.


To further refine my hypothesis, I'd like to see examples with:

*   Different central column colors (other than gray)
*   Varying numbers of gray pixels in the central column
*   Different shapes and distributions of blue pixels in the input.  Ideally examples with entirely different distributions of blue pixels which result in various output arrangements.

Let's move on to the next example.  This analysis reveals important insights.  The pattern appears to be related to the number and positions of non-zero values and the locations of the '5' values.  The output dimensions are likely to be related to the number of '5' values, and perhaps also the distribution of other values.
