Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (6)
    *   `0: white` (10)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`: A central column of three gray pixels, surrounded by blue and white pixels. The blue pixels appear to outline the gray column.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (8)
    *   `2: red` (1)
*   `objects`: A single red pixel in the center.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: 21 cells changed entirely.
*   `colors_changed`:  The input contains blue, white, and gray; while the output only uses white and red. The significant reduction in size suggests an aggregation or summary operation, rather than a direct mapping.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a reduction of the input image followed by a change of color in the central pixel. The original blue and white surrounding the center are discarded. The gray color is replaced by red.  The reduced size suggests a summarization or extraction of a key feature from the input.  The location of the red pixel corresponds to the central column of gray pixels.  It might be helpful to test more examples to see if this is a general pattern (e.g., if other colors get summarized similarly).


I need more examples to confirm the transformation rule.  Specifically, I'd like to see what happens with different input sizes, different central colors and different configurations of the surrounding pixels.
