[[1 0 0 5 0 1 0]
 [0 1 0 5 1 1 1]
 [1 0 0 5 0 0 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x750B4104DE70>

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B3FB261D0>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (6)
    *   `0: white` (10)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`: A central column of three gray pixels, surrounded by blue and white pixels. The blue pixels appear to outline the gray column.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (8)
    *   `2: red` (1)
*   `objects`: A single red pixel in the center.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: 21 cells changed entirely.
*   `colors_changed`:  The input contains blue, white, and gray; while the output only uses white and red. The significant reduction in size suggests an aggregation or summary operation, rather than a direct mapping.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a reduction of the input image followed by a change of color in the central pixel. The original blue and white surrounding the center are discarded. The gray color is replaced by red.  The reduced size suggests a summarization or extraction of a key feature from the input.  The location of the red pixel corresponds to the central column of gray pixels.  It might be helpful to test more examples to see if this is a general pattern (e.g., if other colors get summarized similarly).


I need more examples to confirm the transformation rule.  Specifically, I'd like to see what happens with different input sizes, different central colors and different configurations of the surrounding pixels.


# example_2

## input:

[[1 1 0 5 0 1 0]
 [0 0 1 5 1 1 1]
 [1 1 0 5 0 1 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x750B42286B60>


## output:

[[0 2 0]
 [0 0 2]
 [0 2 0]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B410AB9A0>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building on the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (8)
    *   `0: white` (9)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`:  Similar to example 1, a central column of gray pixels. However, the blue pixels are more distributed around the gray column than in example 1.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (6)
    *   `2: red` (3)
*   `objects`: Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern, with one red pixel in the center and one red pixel in each adjacent row.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: All cells are changed.
*   `colors_changed`: Similar to example 1, the input colors are simplified and reduced to white and red.


**Transformation:**

Example 2 strengthens the hypothesis that the transformation involves:

1.  **Reduction:** The input image is reduced in size.
2.  **Color change:** The central column of gray pixels is replaced with red pixels.
3.  **Pattern change:**  The pattern of red pixels in the output depends on the arrangement of blue pixels in the input, expanding on the idea of aggregation.  In example 1 the gray pixels were surrounded by blue, resulting in a single red pixel. In example 2, blue pixels are dispersed around the central gray column, resulting in a cross pattern of red pixels.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation appears to be a form of feature extraction and representation.  The central column of gray is important, and its final color will be red. The pattern of red in the output is a function of the distribution of blue in the input around that column.


To further refine my hypothesis, I'd like to see examples with:

*   Different central column colors (other than gray)
*   Varying numbers of gray pixels in the central column
*   Different shapes and distributions of blue pixels in the input.  Ideally examples with entirely different distributions of blue pixels which result in various output arrangements.

Let's move on to the next example.  This analysis reveals important insights.  The pattern appears to be related to the number and positions of non-zero values and the locations of the '5' values.  The output dimensions are likely to be related to the number of '5' values, and perhaps also the distribution of other values.


# example_3

## input:

[[0 0 1 5 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 5 1 0 1]
 [0 1 1 5 1 0 1]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x750B3FB27BB0>


## output:

[[0 0 0]
 [2 0 0]
 [0 0 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B3F1667D0>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, continuing the pattern analysis from the previous examples:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (6)
    *   `0: white` (10)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`: A central column of three gray pixels, similar to the previous examples.  The blue pixels surround the gray column, but their distribution is different from the previous examples.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (7)
    *   `2: red` (2)
*   `objects`: Two red pixels are present, located in the bottom-left and top-right corners of the 3x3 grid.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: All cells are changed.
*   `colors_changed`: Input colors are reduced to white and red in the output.


**Transformation:**

Example 3 further refines our understanding of the transformation.  The consistent elements are:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The output is always a 3x3 grid, regardless of input size.
2.  **Central Column Importance:** The central column of `5`s in the input is crucial.
3.  **Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels in the output seem related to the distribution of blue (`1`) pixels surrounding the central gray column. However, the relationship is not entirely clear from these three examples. The pattern is not simply a direct mirroring or counting.

**Hypothesis Refinement and Additional Questions:**

The pattern is more nuanced than initially thought.  A simple count or direct mapping of blue pixels to red pixels doesn't fully explain the output.  There's a clear connection between the central gray column and the output, but the precise algorithm for mapping the surrounding blue pixels to red pixel locations in the 3x3 output remains elusive.

To better understand the transformation, more examples are needed, specifically:

*   Examples with different numbers of blue pixels surrounding the central gray column.
*   Examples with varying distributions of blue pixels (clustered, scattered, etc.).
*   Examples with different input sizes but with the same distribution of blue pixels to understand if the size of the input outside the central column matters.
*   Examples with input grids containing colors other than blue, white, and gray to determine if their presence influences the output.

The current hypothesis is incomplete.  We need more data to discern the complete rule.  The transformation involves a size reduction to 3x3, the substitution of the central column of 5s with the color red and a rule for placing additional red pixels that depends on the distribution of blue pixels in the input but doesn't directly map one to one.
