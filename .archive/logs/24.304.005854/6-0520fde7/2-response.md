Here's an analysis of example_2, building on the observations from example_1:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (8)
    *   `0: white` (9)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`:  Similar to example 1, a central column of gray pixels. However, the blue pixels are more distributed around the gray column than in example 1.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (6)
    *   `2: red` (3)
*   `objects`: Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern, with one red pixel in the center and one red pixel in each adjacent row.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: All cells are changed.
*   `colors_changed`: Similar to example 1, the input colors are simplified and reduced to white and red.


**Transformation:**

Example 2 strengthens the hypothesis that the transformation involves:

1.  **Reduction:** The input image is reduced in size.
2.  **Color change:** The central column of gray pixels is replaced with red pixels.
3.  **Pattern change:**  The pattern of red pixels in the output depends on the arrangement of blue pixels in the input, expanding on the idea of aggregation.  In example 1 the gray pixels were surrounded by blue, resulting in a single red pixel. In example 2, blue pixels are dispersed around the central gray column, resulting in a cross pattern of red pixels.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation appears to be a form of feature extraction and representation.  The central column of gray is important, and its final color will be red. The pattern of red in the output is a function of the distribution of blue in the input around that column.


To further refine my hypothesis, I'd like to see examples with:

*   Different central column colors (other than gray)
*   Varying numbers of gray pixels in the central column
*   Different shapes and distributions of blue pixels in the input.  Ideally examples with entirely different distributions of blue pixels which result in various output arrangements.

Let's move on to the next example.  This analysis reveals important insights.  The pattern appears to be related to the number and positions of non-zero values and the locations of the '5' values.  The output dimensions are likely to be related to the number of '5' values, and perhaps also the distribution of other values.
