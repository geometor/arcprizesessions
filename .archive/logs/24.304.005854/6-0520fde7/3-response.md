Here's an analysis of example_3, continuing the pattern analysis from the previous examples:

**Input:**

*   `width`: 7
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `1: blue` (6)
    *   `0: white` (10)
    *   `5: gray` (3)
*   `objects`: A central column of three gray pixels, similar to the previous examples.  The blue pixels surround the gray column, but their distribution is different from the previous examples.


**Output:**

*   `width`: 3
*   `height`: 3
*   `colors`:
    *   `0: white` (7)
    *   `2: red` (2)
*   `objects`: Two red pixels are present, located in the bottom-left and top-right corners of the 3x3 grid.


**Differences:**

*   `cells_changed`: All cells are changed.
*   `colors_changed`: Input colors are reduced to white and red in the output.


**Transformation:**

Example 3 further refines our understanding of the transformation.  The consistent elements are:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The output is always a 3x3 grid, regardless of input size.
2.  **Central Column Importance:** The central column of `5`s in the input is crucial.
3.  **Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels in the output seem related to the distribution of blue (`1`) pixels surrounding the central gray column. However, the relationship is not entirely clear from these three examples. The pattern is not simply a direct mirroring or counting.

**Hypothesis Refinement and Additional Questions:**

The pattern is more nuanced than initially thought.  A simple count or direct mapping of blue pixels to red pixels doesn't fully explain the output.  There's a clear connection between the central gray column and the output, but the precise algorithm for mapping the surrounding blue pixels to red pixel locations in the 3x3 output remains elusive.

To better understand the transformation, more examples are needed, specifically:

*   Examples with different numbers of blue pixels surrounding the central gray column.
*   Examples with varying distributions of blue pixels (clustered, scattered, etc.).
*   Examples with different input sizes but with the same distribution of blue pixels to understand if the size of the input outside the central column matters.
*   Examples with input grids containing colors other than blue, white, and gray to determine if their presence influences the output.

The current hypothesis is incomplete.  We need more data to discern the complete rule.  The transformation involves a size reduction to 3x3, the substitution of the central column of 5s with the color red and a rule for placing additional red pixels that depends on the distribution of blue pixels in the input but doesn't directly map one to one.
