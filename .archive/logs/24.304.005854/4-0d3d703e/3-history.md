# example_1

## input:

[[3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B405A8EB0>


## output:

[[4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]]

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 2: (3) red
    - 3: (3) green
  - objects:
    - Three 1x1 squares, one each of blue, red, and green, repeated vertically.


**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 5: (3) gray
    - 6: (3) magenta
  - objects:
    - Three 1x1 squares, one each of yellow, gray, and magenta, repeated vertically.


**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid.  There's a consistent mapping: 1->4, 2->5, 3->6


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping or substitution.  Each input color is replaced by a different color, and the spatial arrangement remains the same.  The color mapping seems arbitrary without more examples.  There is no apparent relationship between the numerical color values, suggesting the rule is based on the visual appearance of the colors or some other external data source.


To further understand the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples with different input colors and their corresponding outputs would help to confirm if this is a consistent mapping.

[[2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B410FCD60>


## output:

[[6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]]

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, along with an updated hypothesis based on both examples:

**example_2 observations:**

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 2: (3) red
    - 3: (3) green
    - 8: (3) azure
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of red, green, and azure, repeated vertically.

**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 6: (3) magenta
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 9: (3) maroon
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of magenta, yellow, and maroon, repeated vertically.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  A different color mapping than in example 1: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is again a color mapping, but a *different* mapping than in example 1.  This suggests that the mapping isn't based on a simple numerical relationship or a consistent visual pattern across all colors.


**Updated hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to be a rule-based color mapping.  However, the mapping is not fixed; it depends on the input colors. It isn't based on a direct numerical relationship (adding a constant, multiplying, etc.) or a clear visual characteristic (hue, saturation, brightness). We need more examples to determine the underlying rule governing the mapping.  The rule might be determined by an external mapping table or a more complex function not easily expressed with simple mathematical operations.


The provided examples are insufficient to determine the underlying rule definitively. More examples with varied input colors and arrangements are crucial to identifying the complete transformation rule.  The rule appears context-dependent, making it a challenge to determine a precise formula or algorithm without further data.

## observations:

- review the example grids

- check for differences and patterns
