Here's an analysis of example_2, along with an updated hypothesis based on both examples:

**example_2 observations:**

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 2: (3) red
    - 3: (3) green
    - 8: (3) azure
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of red, green, and azure, repeated vertically.

**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 6: (3) magenta
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 9: (3) maroon
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of magenta, yellow, and maroon, repeated vertically.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  A different color mapping than in example 1: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is again a color mapping, but a *different* mapping than in example 1.  This suggests that the mapping isn't based on a simple numerical relationship or a consistent visual pattern across all colors.


**Updated hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to be a rule-based color mapping.  However, the mapping is not fixed; it depends on the input colors. It isn't based on a direct numerical relationship (adding a constant, multiplying, etc.) or a clear visual characteristic (hue, saturation, brightness). We need more examples to determine the underlying rule governing the mapping.  The rule might be determined by an external mapping table or a more complex function not easily expressed with simple mathematical operations.


The provided examples are insufficient to determine the underlying rule definitively. More examples with varied input colors and arrangements are crucial to identifying the complete transformation rule.  The rule appears context-dependent, making it a challenge to determine a precise formula or algorithm without further data.
