Here's an analysis of example_4, incorporating observations from the previous examples:

**example_4 observations:**

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 9: (3) maroon
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 2: (3) red
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of maroon, yellow, and red, repeated vertically.

**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 8: (3) azure
    - 3: (3) green
    - 6: (3) magenta
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of azure, green, and magenta, repeated vertically.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  A different color mapping than in examples 1, 2, and 3: 9->8, 4->3, 2->6

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is yet another color mapping, unique from the previous examples. This strongly suggests a lookup table or a complex, context-dependent rule, rather than a simple mathematical operation on the color values.


**Unified Hypothesis (incorporating all four examples):**

The transformation is a complex, context-dependent color mapping.  There's no simple, consistent mathematical or visual relationship between input and output colors that holds across all examples. Instead, the most likely explanation is a lookup table where each unique combination of input colors is mapped to a specific output color set.

**Further Considerations and Testing:**

To rigorously test this hypothesis and potentially reconstruct the lookup table, we would need significantly more data, including examples with:

1.  **Different combinations of input colors:** Not just sets of three repeated colors but sets with various combinations and more colors.
2.  **Different numbers of colors:**  Examples with only one or two distinct input colors.
3.  **Different grid sizes:** Varying the dimensions to ensure the mapping rule applies consistently.
4.  **Non-uniform input grids:**  Inputs where colors are not arranged uniformly.


The pattern of the transformations strongly suggests that the AI is following a deterministic but complex rule that is unlikely to be discovered through simple mathematical analysis without a much larger dataset.  The rule likely involves a hidden mapping or table that maps input color sets to output color sets.
