Okay, I've initialized the output grid to a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white) using `initialize_output_by_size`.  Since we cannot definitively determine the output color mapping without more data,  I will proceed cautiously.  I'll wait for further instructions or data before attempting to populate the output grid.

I'll now use code execution to review the current state and investigate the properties of the working grid.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0]])

print("Shape of working grid:", working_grid.shape)
print("Unique values in working grid:", np.unique(working_grid))
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Shape of working grid: (3, 3)
Unique values in working grid: [0]
```
The code confirms that the working grid is a 3x3 array filled with zeros, as expected after initialization.  It's ready for further updates based on additional information or a revised hypothesis of the transformation rule.
