Based on the four examples, the transformation applied to the input grid to produce the output grid is a context-dependent color remapping.  There's no simple mathematical formula or easily discernible visual pattern relating input and output colors. Instead, the evidence strongly suggests a lookup table (or equivalent complex function) is used to determine the output color set based on the input color set.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Consistent Structure:**  All examples maintain the spatial arrangement of colors. The output grid has the same dimensions and relative positioning of colors as the input.
*   **Complete Color Remapping:** In each example, every cell's color changes.
*   **Context-Dependent Mapping:** The color mapping is different for each example.  There's no constant addition, subtraction, multiplication, or other arithmetic operation that consistently transforms the input color values to output values.  This eliminates simple mathematical relationships.
*   **No Simple Visual Pattern:**  There's no readily apparent relationship between the input colors and the output colors based on visual properties (like hue, saturation, brightness).


**Code Execution to Investigate Patterns (Illustrative):**

The following code doesn't solve the puzzle directly but demonstrates how code can help analyze the data and look for patterns.  It's crucial to have more data (many more examples) to use these techniques effectively.  This analysis uses a limited dataset and is likely inconclusive, but provides a model for a more thorough analysis of the data.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Data from the examples (input and output colors)
data = {
    'input': [[3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 8], [5, 8, 6], [9, 4, 2]],
    'output': [[4, 5, 6], [6, 4, 9], [1, 9, 2], [8, 3, 6]]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert lists of lists to numpy arrays for easier manipulation
df['input'] = df['input'].apply(np.array)
df['output'] = df['output'].apply(np.array)

# Attempt to find numerical relationships (This is unlikely to succeed given the observations)

# Example: Check for additive relationships (this will be unsuccessful)
df['diff'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['output'] - row['input'], axis=1)
print(df) # Output shows no simple numerical relationship

#  More sophisticated pattern detection would require machine learning techniques (not demonstrated here due to limitations of this environment)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
       input     output         diff
0  [3, 1, 2]  [4, 5, 6]    [1, 4, 4]
1  [2, 3, 8]  [6, 4, 9]    [4, 1, 1]
2  [5, 8, 6]  [1, 9, 2]  [-4, 1, -4]
3  [9, 4, 2]  [8, 3, 6]  [-1, -1, 4]

```

The tool output confirms my hypothesis that there is no simple numerical relationship between input and output.  The differences vary wildly between rows, indicating a more complex transformation.  To proceed, we need a more substantial dataset of examples to either discover a pattern or confirm the hypothesis that a lookup table (or equivalent complex function) is at play.  Simple mathematical analysis alone is unlikely to yield a solution without more data.
