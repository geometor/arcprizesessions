Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 2: (3) red
    - 3: (3) green
  - objects:
    - Three 1x1 squares, one each of blue, red, and green, repeated vertically.


**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 5: (3) gray
    - 6: (3) magenta
  - objects:
    - Three 1x1 squares, one each of yellow, gray, and magenta, repeated vertically.


**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid.  There's a consistent mapping: 1->4, 2->5, 3->6


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping or substitution.  Each input color is replaced by a different color, and the spatial arrangement remains the same.  The color mapping seems arbitrary without more examples.  There is no apparent relationship between the numerical color values, suggesting the rule is based on the visual appearance of the colors or some other external data source.


To further understand the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples with different input colors and their corresponding outputs would help to confirm if this is a consistent mapping.
