# example_1

## input:

[[3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B405A8EB0>

 [4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B410FD000>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 2: (3) red
    - 3: (3) green
  - objects:
    - Three 1x1 squares, one each of blue, red, and green, repeated vertically.


**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 5: (3) gray
    - 6: (3) magenta
  - objects:
    - Three 1x1 squares, one each of yellow, gray, and magenta, repeated vertically.


**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid.  There's a consistent mapping: 1->4, 2->5, 3->6


**transformation:**
  - The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping or substitution.  Each input color is replaced by a different color, and the spatial arrangement remains the same.  The color mapping seems arbitrary without more examples.  There is no apparent relationship between the numerical color values, suggesting the rule is based on the visual appearance of the colors or some other external data source.


To further understand the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples with different input colors and their corresponding outputs would help to confirm if this is a consistent mapping.

[[2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B410FCD60>

[[6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B42286B60>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, along with an updated hypothesis based on both examples:

**example_2 observations:**

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 2: (3) red
    - 3: (3) green
    - 8: (3) azure
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of red, green, and azure, repeated vertically.

**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 6: (3) magenta
    - 4: (3) yellow
    - 9: (3) maroon
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of magenta, yellow, and maroon, repeated vertically.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  A different color mapping than in example 1: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is again a color mapping, but a *different* mapping than in example 1.  This suggests that the mapping isn't based on a simple numerical relationship or a consistent visual pattern across all colors.


**Updated hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to be a rule-based color mapping.  However, the mapping is not fixed; it depends on the input colors. It isn't based on a direct numerical relationship (adding a constant, multiplying, etc.) or a clear visual characteristic (hue, saturation, brightness). We need more examples to determine the underlying rule governing the mapping.  The rule might be determined by an external mapping table or a more complex function not easily expressed with simple mathematical operations.


The provided examples are insufficient to determine the underlying rule definitively. More examples with varied input colors and arrangements are crucial to identifying the complete transformation rule.  The rule appears context-dependent, making it a challenge to determine a precise formula or algorithm without further data.

 [1 9 2]]


<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x750B3FB261D0>


## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_3, incorporating observations from the previous examples:

**example_3 observations:**

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 5: (3) gray
    - 8: (3) azure
    - 6: (3) magenta
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of gray, azure, and magenta, repeated vertically.

**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 9: (3) maroon
    - 2: (3) red
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of blue, maroon, and red, repeated vertically.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  A different color mapping than in examples 1 and 2: 5->1, 8->9, 6->2

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is again a color mapping, but a *different* mapping than in examples 1 and 2.  This reinforces the hypothesis that the mapping is not based on a simple, consistent rule across all inputs.

**Updated hypothesis (incorporating all three examples):**

The transformation is a context-dependent color mapping. There is no single, easily expressible mathematical or visual rule that predicts the output colors from the input colors. The mapping seems to be determined by some external lookup table or a complex, potentially non-linear, function that takes the entire input grid as input.  Further examples are needed to confirm this and potentially discover the lookup table or functional relationship.


The current hypothesis is that there is a unique mapping for each set of input colors.  We need more data (more example inputs and outputs) to confirm this or determine if there's a more sophisticated underlying pattern.


To better understand this, I would propose testing with various inputs including:

1.  Different grid sizes (e.g. 2x2, 4x4, etc.) to see if the mapping scales consistently.
2.  Inputs with mixed colors, not just repeated colors.
3.  Inputs where not all three colors are present in the input.

This additional data could reveal if there's a pattern we haven't yet noticed or if there is indeed a non-deterministic element to the color mapping.
