Here's an analysis of example_3, incorporating observations from the previous examples:

**example_3 observations:**

**input:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 5: (3) gray
    - 8: (3) azure
    - 6: (3) magenta
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of gray, azure, and magenta, repeated vertically.

**output:**
  - width: 3
  - height: 3
  - colors:
    - 1: (3) blue
    - 9: (3) maroon
    - 2: (3) red
  - objects: Three 1x1 squares of blue, maroon, and red, repeated vertically.

**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 9
  - colors_changed: All cells changed.  A different color mapping than in examples 1 and 2: 5->1, 8->9, 6->2

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is again a color mapping, but a *different* mapping than in examples 1 and 2.  This reinforces the hypothesis that the mapping is not based on a simple, consistent rule across all inputs.

**Updated hypothesis (incorporating all three examples):**

The transformation is a context-dependent color mapping. There is no single, easily expressible mathematical or visual rule that predicts the output colors from the input colors. The mapping seems to be determined by some external lookup table or a complex, potentially non-linear, function that takes the entire input grid as input.  Further examples are needed to confirm this and potentially discover the lookup table or functional relationship.


The current hypothesis is that there is a unique mapping for each set of input colors.  We need more data (more example inputs and outputs) to confirm this or determine if there's a more sophisticated underlying pattern.


To better understand this, I would propose testing with various inputs including:

1.  Different grid sizes (e.g. 2x2, 4x4, etc.) to see if the mapping scales consistently.
2.  Inputs with mixed colors, not just repeated colors.
3.  Inputs where not all three colors are present in the input.

This additional data could reveal if there's a pattern we haven't yet noticed or if there is indeed a non-deterministic element to the color mapping.
