The transformation in both examples involves replacing a subset of azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels are replaced isn't immediately obvious from a simple geometric or numerical pattern based on the provided examples. There's no consistent change in the number of azure pixels between the input and output grids; only a replacement occurs.

Let's investigate the spatial relationships of the changed pixels using code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

example2_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])


def find_changed_pixels(input_grid, output_grid):
    diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
    changed_pixels = list(zip(diff[0], diff[1]))
    return changed_pixels

example1_changes = find_changed_pixels(example1_input, example1_output)
example2_changes = find_changed_pixels(example2_input, example2_output)

print("Example 1 changed pixels:", example1_changes)
print("Example 2 changed pixels:", example2_changes)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 changed pixels: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4))]
Example 2 changed pixels: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3))]

```

The coordinates of the changed pixels in each example don't reveal an obvious pattern.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a consistent rule governing the selection of these pixels.  The rule might be based on the relative position of the azure pixels within their cluster, their proximity to the edges of the grid, or a more complex spatial relationship.  The current data is insufficient to definitively determine the transformation rule.
