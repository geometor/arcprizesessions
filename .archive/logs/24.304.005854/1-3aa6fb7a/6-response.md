Okay, I've initialized the working output grid from the test input.  Let's proceed iteratively, replacing candidate azure pixels with blue pixels, guided by the patterns observed in the examples.

Based on the previous examples, the algorithm seems to select azure pixels that are either isolated or at the periphery of the azure clusters.

I'll start by selecting a candidate pixel and making the change.  Then we can review the new grid and make further adjustments as needed.

**Iteration 1:**

I'll select pixel at [0,5].  it is at the edge of a cluster.

function_call:
set_pixel(0,5,1)

result:
set_pixel(0, 5, 1)
# working output grid
updated with your changes
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

plt.imshow(working_grid, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Working Grid Heatmap")
plt.show()

```

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

The heatmap shows the distribution of pixel values. Let's continue with another iteration.


**Iteration 2:**

Let's select pixel at [1,6].  This pixel is also on the edge of a cluster.

function_call:
set_pixel(1,6,1)

result:
set_pixel(1, 6, 1)
# working output grid

 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]


heatmap:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

plt.imshow(working_grid, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Working Grid Heatmap")
plt.show()

```

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

**Iteration 3:**

Let's select the pixel at [5,1]. It seems like a good candidate based on the previous examples.


function_call:
set_pixel(5,1,1)

result:
set_pixel(5, 1, 1)
# working output grid

[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]

 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

heatmap:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

plt.imshow(working_grid, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Working Grid Heatmap")
plt.show()

```

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

**Iteration 4:**

Let's try replacing the pixel at position [2,0]. It appears isolated.


function_call:
set_pixel(2,0,1)

result:
set_pixel(2, 0, 1)
# working output grid
updated with your changes
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

heatmap:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

plt.imshow(working_grid, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Working Grid Heatmap")
plt.show()

```

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

Based on the pattern observed in the examples, I believe we've identified most of the pixels to be changed. Let's submit this solution.  I can't guarantee it's correct without more examples to confirm the pattern, but this is the most likely solution based on the data provided.

function_call:
submit([[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 1]
 [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]])
