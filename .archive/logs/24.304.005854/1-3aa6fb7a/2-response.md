Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a combined analysis of both examples:

**example_2 observations:**

**input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - A scattered cluster of 8 'azure' pixels.
```

**output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - A scattered cluster of 8 'azure' pixels.
  - 3 'blue' pixels replacing some 'azure' pixels.
```

**differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
```

**transformation:**

Similar to example 1, some azure pixels are replaced with blue pixels.  The locations are different, but the transformation is consistent in that it is a replacement, not an addition or removal of pixels.

**Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where a subset of azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1) pixels. There's no immediately obvious geometric pattern (like corners, edges, or specific shapes) or numerical pattern (like pixel counts or proximity).  The placement of the blue pixels does not appear random however,  suggesting there might be an underlying rule based on the spatial relationship of the azure pixels to each other and to the grid boundaries.  This is not yet clear but would be illuminated with additional examples.

**Hypothesis:**

The algorithm might be identifying specific azure pixels within the overall cluster based on their location relative to other azure pixels and/or the grid boundaries.  To test this, we need more examples with varying sizes and arrangements of azure pixels.  The key is to study the locations of the 'blue' pixels to see if there is a consistent method for choosing those particular pixels.
