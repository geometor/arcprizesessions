## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - a cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - a cluster of 6 'azure' pixels.
  - 2 'blue' pixels replacing some 'azure' pixels, one at [1,2] and one at [4,4].
```

**differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
```

**transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve replacing specific azure pixels with blue pixels.  There's no immediately obvious geometric or numerical pattern to where the changes occur.  It might involve a spatial relationship to other pixels or perhaps a hidden pattern that's not immediately clear from just this one example.  More examples are needed to determine if there is a consistent rule.

To fully understand the transformation, more examples are required to look for patterns in placement of the blue pixels in relation to the azure cluster or the grid boundaries.
