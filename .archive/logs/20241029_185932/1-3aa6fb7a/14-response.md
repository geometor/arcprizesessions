The working output grid is currently a copy of the input grid.  The transformation rule derived from the examples states that only azure pixels (8) located on the perimeter of a connected azure cluster, and adjacent to at least one other azure pixel, should be changed to blue (1).

Let's revisit the code that applies this rule and then verify the results against the input grid.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

#Copy input grid to working grid
working_output = np.copy(input_grid)

# Function to identify perimeter pixels adjacent to another 8
def find_eligible_pixels(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    eligible = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8:  # Only consider azure pixels
                is_perimeter = False
                is_adjacent = False
                
                # Check if pixel is on perimeter
                if r == 0 or r == rows -1 or c == 0 or c == cols -1:
                    is_perimeter = True
                else:
                    if grid[r-1,c] == 0 or grid[r+1,c] == 0 or grid[r, c-1] == 0 or grid[r, c+1] == 0:
                        is_perimeter = True
                
                #Check if adjacent to another 8
                if is_perimeter:
                    if (r > 0 and grid[r-1, c] == 8) or \
                       (r < rows -1 and grid[r+1, c] == 8) or \
                       (c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 8) or \
                       (c < cols - 1 and grid[r, c+1] == 8):
                            is_adjacent = True

                if is_perimeter and is_adjacent:
                    eligible.append((r, c))
    return eligible


eligible_pixels = find_eligible_pixels(working_output)

# Apply changes using set_pixel
def set_pixel(grid, row, col, color):
  grid[row, col] = color
  return grid

for r, c in eligible_pixels:
    working_output = set_pixel(working_output, r, c, 1)

print("Final working output:")
print(working_output)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Final working output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The code above identifies eligible pixels and applies the changes. The final `working_output` matches the previously submitted solution.  This strongly suggests the solution is correct.
