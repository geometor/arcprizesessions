Okay, I understand.  Since the solution involves only a few changes, using `set_pixel` is efficient. Let's re-execute the code that applies the changes using `set_pixel`, and then submit the solution again using the `submit` function.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Apply changes based on identified coordinates
def set_pixel(grid, row, col, color):
    grid[row, col] = color
    return grid

working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 5, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 1, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 5, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 1, 1)


def submit(grid):
    print("Submitting the following grid:")
    print(grid)

submit(working_output)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Submitting the following grid:
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
```
The code above shows the updated grid being submitted.  I await confirmation of the solution's correctness.  If the submission is deemed incorrect, I will need to re-evaluate my understanding of the transformation rule.  Otherwise, I am ready to proceed to the next puzzle.
