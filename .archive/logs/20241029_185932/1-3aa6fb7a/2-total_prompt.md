## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels forms an irregular shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Two blue pixels appear, one adjacent to an azure pixel in the second row, and one adjacent to an azure pixel in the fifth row.

**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.

**transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to involve replacing some of the azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it seems that a subset of edge azure pixels that have adjacent azure pixels become blue.  The replacement happens such that it does not break connectivity of the remaining azure cluster.  Further examples are needed to confirm the exact rules.
