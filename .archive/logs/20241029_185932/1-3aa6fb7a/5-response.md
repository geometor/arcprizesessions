Given that the examples show only a few changes between input and output (some azure pixels changing to blue), it's more efficient to start with `initialize_output_from_input`.  This avoids unnecessary steps.


code_execution:


function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:

initialize_output_from_input()
