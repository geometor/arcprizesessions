The working output grid is not yet updated with the changes.  The `submit()` function needs to receive the updated `working_output` array.  Let's correct this.



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Apply changes based on identified coordinates
def set_pixel(grid, row, col, color):
    grid[row, col] = color
    return grid

working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 5, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 1, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 5, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 1, 1)


def submit(grid):
    print("Submitting the following grid:")
    print(grid)

submit(working_output)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Submitting the following grid:
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

The `submit` function now correctly receives the updated `working_output` array. The output shows the final grid that is being submitted.  The solution is consistent with the rules derived from the examples.
