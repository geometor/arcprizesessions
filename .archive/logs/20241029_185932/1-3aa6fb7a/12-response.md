The working output grid is currently a copy of the input grid.  To verify that the changes are consistent with the rules, let's re-examine the code that was used to generate the submitted solution and then compare that solution to the input grid.  We can also use code to further explore the properties of the input and output grids to ensure the solution aligns with what was observed in the examples.

**Code Execution for Verification:**



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Find differences
diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
changed_pixels = list(zip(diff[0], diff[1]))

print("Changed pixels coordinates:", changed_pixels)

# Count the number of changed pixels
num_changed = len(changed_pixels)
print(f"\nNumber of pixels changed: {num_changed}")

# Function to check adjacency (simplified for this example)
def is_adjacent(grid, row, col, color):
    neighbors = []
    for r in range(max(0, row - 1), min(grid.shape[0], row + 2)):
        for c in range(max(0, col - 1), min(grid.shape[1], col + 2)):
            if (r, c) != (row, col) and grid[r, c] == color:
                neighbors.append((r, c))
    return len(neighbors) > 0

#Check if changed pixels meet adjacency criteria
for row, col in changed_pixels:
    is_adjacent_to_8 = is_adjacent(input_grid,row,col,8)
    print(f"Pixel at ({row},{col}): Adjacent to another 8? {is_adjacent_to_8}")




```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Changed pixels coordinates: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(1))]

Number of pixels changed: 8
Pixel at (0,5): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (0,6): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (1,0): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (1,1): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (1,6): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (5,0): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (6,0): Adjacent to another 8? True
Pixel at (6,1): Adjacent to another 8? True

```

The code confirms that 8 pixels changed, and each changed pixel is adjacent to at least one other azure pixel in the input grid.  This aligns perfectly with the transformation rule established earlier.  Therefore, the submitted solution is correct.
