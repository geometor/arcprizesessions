Here's an analysis of the test input, followed by a proposed solution based on the established transformation rules:

**Test Input Analysis:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (36)
    *   8: (12)
*   objects:
    *   The azure pixels (8) form a fragmented shape with three main clusters: a top right cluster of 2, an L shape in the top left with 4 and a bottom left cluster of 6.

**Proposed Solution:**

Based on the established transformation rules from examples 1 and 2, the solution involves identifying azure pixels that meet the following criteria:

1.  They are on the perimeter of a cluster of azure pixels.
2.  They are adjacent to at least one other azure pixel.

Applying these criteria to the test input, the following pixels should change from azure (8) to blue (1):

*   (0, 5):  Top right cluster. It's on the perimeter and adjacent to another 8.
*   (0, 6): Top right cluster. It's on the perimeter and adjacent to another 8.
*   (1, 0): Top left cluster. It's on the perimeter and adjacent to other 8s.
*   (1, 1): Top left cluster. It's on the perimeter and adjacent to other 8s.
*   (1, 6): It is on the perimeter and is adjacent to another 8.
*   (5, 0): Bottom left cluster.  It is on the perimeter and adjacent to another 8.
*   (6, 0): Bottom left cluster. It is on the perimeter and adjacent to another 8.
*   (6,1): Bottom left cluster. It is on the perimeter and adjacent to another 8.


Therefore, the pixels at these coordinates should be changed to 1.

Let's represent the solution using a NumPy array and then visualize it:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

test_output = np.copy(test_input)
test_output[0, 5] = 1
test_output[0, 6] = 1
test_output[1, 0] = 1
test_output[1, 1] = 1
test_output[1, 6] = 1
test_output[5, 0] = 1
test_output[6, 0] = 1
test_output[6, 1] = 1

print(test_output)

```

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

This numpy array represents the predicted output grid.  I await your instructions on how to proceed with submitting this solution.  I believe this is a pixel perfect solution given the examples and my understanding of the rules.
