## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels forms an irregular shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Two blue pixels appear, one adjacent to an azure pixel in the second row, and one adjacent to an azure pixel in the fifth row.

**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.

**transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to involve replacing some of the azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it seems that a subset of edge azure pixels that have adjacent azure pixels become blue.  The replacement happens such that it does not break connectivity of the remaining azure cluster.  Further examples are needed to confirm the exact rules.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a synthesis of both examples:

**example_2:**

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels in an L shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Three blue pixels appear, each adjacent to an azure pixel and on an edge of the azure cluster.


**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

**transformation:**

*   Similar to example 1, azure pixels are replaced by blue pixels.  The placement of the blue pixels suggests that *only* azure pixels on the outer edge of the cluster that also are adjacent to another azure pixel are changed to blue.


**Synthesis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where a subset of azure pixels are changed to blue. The rule appears to be:

1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Find connected groups of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Edge Detection:** Find azure pixels on the outer edge of each cluster.
3.  **Adjacency Check:**  Only change azure pixels to blue (1) if they are adjacent to at least one other azure pixel.

This rule maintains the connectivity of the azure cluster while adding blue pixels to its perimeter.  The number of blue pixels added seems related to the number of qualifying edge azure pixels, but further examples are needed to confirm.

Let me know when you are ready to proceed to the test phase.
