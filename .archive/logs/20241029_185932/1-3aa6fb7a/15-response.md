Okay, I understand. Let's use the `set_pixel` function to update the working grid and then submit the solution.  I'll use the coordinates identified previously.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Apply changes using set_pixel
def set_pixel(grid, row, col, color):
    grid[row, col] = color
    return grid

working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 5, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 1, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 5, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 1, 1)

print("Updated working grid:")
print(working_output)

# Submit the solution
def submit(grid):
    print("\nSubmitting the following grid:")
    print(grid)

submit(working_output)

```
