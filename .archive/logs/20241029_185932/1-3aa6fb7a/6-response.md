Okay, I understand.  The `initialize_output_from_input` function has created a working output grid that's a perfect copy of the test input.  Now we need to apply the transformation rules to change specific pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

Let's use the `set_pixel` function to make these changes one by one, based on the coordinates I identified earlier.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

# Apply changes based on identified coordinates
def set_pixel(grid, row, col, color):
    grid[row, col] = color
    return grid

working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 5, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 0, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 1, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 1, 6, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 5, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 0, 1)
working_output = set_pixel(working_output, 6, 1, 1)


print(working_output)
```
code_execution_result: 2
```
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

The `working_output` grid now reflects the changes. This matches my prediction and the solution presented earlier. I am ready to submit.
