Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42) white
    *   8: (6) azure
*   objects: One cluster of azure pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40) white
    *   1: (2) blue
    *   8: (6) azure
*   objects: Similar to the input, but two azure pixels have been changed to blue.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The specific pixels changed appear to be those that are adjacent to other azure pixels but also only on the edges. This is not conclusive from a single example.  Further examples are needed to determine the complete rule.  The location of the changed pixels suggests a possible rule related to boundary detection of the azure cluster.

I need more examples to confirm this hypothesis and refine the transformation rule.  The rule may be more complex, or it might involve other factors not immediately apparent.
