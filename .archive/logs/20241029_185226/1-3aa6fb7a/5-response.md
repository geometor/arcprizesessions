Given that the examples show relatively few differences between input and output, and the transformation involves modifications to existing cells rather than complete grid restructuring, initializing the output grid from the input grid is the most appropriate approach.  This ensures that the base structure and existing azure pixels are preserved, allowing the algorithm to focus on adding the blue pixels based on their spatial relationship to the azure pixels.

Therefore, I will use `initialize_output_from_input` to initialize the working output grid.  I will then apply the (currently still imperfect) `transform_grid` function to add the predicted blue pixels.  The subsequent review steps will allow for manual adjustments if necessary.

code_execution:


function_call:

initialize_output_from_input


result:

initialize_output_from_input()
