## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   The same azure cluster as in the input.
    *   Two blue pixels, one replacing an adjacent white pixel above a top azure pixel, one replacing a white pixel below a bottom azure pixel.


**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two white pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to involve adding two blue pixels.  The positions of the added blue pixels seem to be determined by the positions of the existing azure pixels in the input. Specifically, a blue pixel is added directly above one of the azure pixels at the top of the cluster and one directly below an azure pixel at the bottom.  There may be some additional constraints, but this initial observation holds true.

## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped form.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (36)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (4)
*   objects:
    *   The same azure cluster as in the input.
    *   Four blue pixels added adjacent to the azure pixels, similar to example 1.


**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 4
*   colors_changed: Four white pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   This example reinforces the pattern observed in example 1.  Blue pixels (1) are added adjacent to azure pixels (8). It appears that a blue pixel is added to each  side of each azure pixel that doesn't already have an adjacent azure pixel (horizontally or vertically adjacent).  There's a noticeable absence of blue pixels being added diagonally, and there's no blue pixel added to the azure cluster if there's already an azure pixel next to it.

**Comparison with Example 1:**

Both examples demonstrate the addition of blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels, with the primary difference being the number and placement of the additions due to the varying shapes and distributions of the azure clusters in the input grids.  The consistency of the "add blue adjacent to azure" rule is notable.  There is no evidence so far to suggest that shape or size of the azure object affects this operation.


# examples summary: 

The transformation rule appears to be consistently adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  The addition only occurs to sides (horizontally or vertically) of azure pixels that do not already have an adjacent azure pixel. Diagonally adjacent azure pixels do not trigger the addition of a blue pixel.

Let's verify this using code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def transform_grid(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 8:
                #check adjacent cells
                if i > 0 and input_grid[i-1, j] == 0:
                    output_grid[i-1, j] = 1
                if i < rows - 1 and input_grid[i+1, j] == 0:
                    output_grid[i+1, j] = 1
                if j > 0 and input_grid[i, j-1] == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j-1] = 1
                if j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i, j+1] == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j+1] = 1
    return output_grid

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

example1_output = transform_grid(example1_input)
example2_output = transform_grid(example2_input)

print("Example 1 Output:\n", example1_output)
print("\nExample 2 Output:\n", example2_output)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 Output:
 [[0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 8 1 1 1 0]
 [0 1 1 1 8 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 1 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Example 2 Output:
 [[0 0 0 1 8 8 1]
 [0 0 1 0 1 8 1]
 [0 1 8 1 0 1 0]
 [0 1 8 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 1 0]
 [0 0 1 8 8 1 0]]

```

The code's output does not perfectly match the provided example outputs.  The algorithm correctly identifies locations to place blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels; however,  it appears my initial understanding of the rule was too simplistic. The rule seems more nuanced than simply adding a blue pixel to every available adjacent white space. There is a pattern in the incorrect predictions, but more examples are needed to refine this rule to achieve perfect accuracy.  The rule needs further refinement to account for these discrepancies.  More examples are needed to fully define the transformation rule, including potentially considering diagonal adjacency and cluster shape factors.
