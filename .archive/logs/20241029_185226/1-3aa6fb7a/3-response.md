The transformation rule appears to be consistently adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to azure (8) pixels in the input grid.  The addition only occurs to sides (horizontally or vertically) of azure pixels that do not already have an adjacent azure pixel. Diagonally adjacent azure pixels do not trigger the addition of a blue pixel.

Let's verify this using code:



code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def transform_grid(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 8:
                #check adjacent cells
                if i > 0 and input_grid[i-1, j] == 0:
                    output_grid[i-1, j] = 1
                if i < rows - 1 and input_grid[i+1, j] == 0:
                    output_grid[i+1, j] = 1
                if j > 0 and input_grid[i, j-1] == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j-1] = 1
                if j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i, j+1] == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j+1] = 1
    return output_grid

example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

example1_output = transform_grid(example1_input)
example2_output = transform_grid(example2_input)

print("Example 1 Output:\n", example1_output)
print("\nExample 2 Output:\n", example2_output)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 Output:
 [[0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 8 1 1 1 0]
 [0 1 1 1 8 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 1 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Example 2 Output:
 [[0 0 0 1 8 8 1]
 [0 0 1 0 1 8 1]
 [0 1 8 1 0 1 0]
 [0 1 8 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 1 0]
 [0 0 1 8 8 1 0]]

```

The code's output does not perfectly match the provided example outputs.  The algorithm correctly identifies locations to place blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels; however,  it appears my initial understanding of the rule was too simplistic. The rule seems more nuanced than simply adding a blue pixel to every available adjacent white space. There is a pattern in the incorrect predictions, but more examples are needed to refine this rule to achieve perfect accuracy.  The rule needs further refinement to account for these discrepancies.  More examples are needed to fully define the transformation rule, including potentially considering diagonal adjacency and cluster shape factors.
