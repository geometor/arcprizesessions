Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 8 azure pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped form.

**output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (36)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (4)
*   objects:
    *   The same azure cluster as in the input.
    *   Four blue pixels added adjacent to the azure pixels, similar to example 1.


**differences:**

*   cells_changed: 4
*   colors_changed: Four white pixels changed to blue (1).

**transformation:**

*   This example reinforces the pattern observed in example 1.  Blue pixels (1) are added adjacent to azure pixels (8). It appears that a blue pixel is added to each  side of each azure pixel that doesn't already have an adjacent azure pixel (horizontally or vertically adjacent).  There's a noticeable absence of blue pixels being added diagonally, and there's no blue pixel added to the azure cluster if there's already an azure pixel next to it.

**Comparison with Example 1:**

Both examples demonstrate the addition of blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels, with the primary difference being the number and placement of the additions due to the varying shapes and distributions of the azure clusters in the input grids.  The consistency of the "add blue adjacent to azure" rule is notable.  There is no evidence so far to suggest that shape or size of the azure object affects this operation.
