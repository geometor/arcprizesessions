The working output grid is currently unchanged from the input grid because I have not yet applied a transformation.  My attempts to create a transformation rule have been hampered by the limited number of examples and the apparent complexity of the transformation.

The `transform_grid` function I created provides a *partial* solution based on a simplified "add blue adjacent to azure" rule.  However, this rule is insufficient to perfectly replicate the example outputs, and the result applied to the test input grid is likely incorrect.

To accurately determine the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  The current approach, even with refinements to the `transform_grid` function, will remain inaccurate without significantly more data.  A more sophisticated methodology, such as a machine learning approach (using a model suitable for handling spatial data like a CNN or GNN), may be necessary once a larger dataset is available.  This approach would allow the model to learn the intricate, non-linear relationships between input and output grids that simple rule-based systems fail to capture.  Without further data, I am unable to confidently proceed with the puzzle solution.
