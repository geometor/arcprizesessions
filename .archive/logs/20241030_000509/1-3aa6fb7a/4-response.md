Here's an analysis of the test input grid, following the format established in the examples:

code_execution:


code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

def count_colors(grid):
    colors = {}
    for row in grid:
        for val in row:
            colors[val] = colors.get(val, 0) + 1
    return colors

print("Color counts:")
print(count_colors(test_input))

def find_azure_blocks(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    azure_blocks = []
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                block = []
                q = [(r, c)]
                while q:
                    curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)
                    if 0 <= curr_r < rows and 0 <= curr_c < cols and grid[curr_r, curr_c] == 8 and not visited[curr_r, curr_c]:
                        block.append((curr_r, curr_c))
                        visited[curr_r, curr_c] = True
                        q.extend([(curr_r + 1, curr_c), (curr_r - 1, curr_c), (curr_r, curr_c + 1), (curr_r, curr_c - 1)])
                azure_blocks.append(block)
    return azure_blocks

print("\nAzure blocks:")
print(find_azure_blocks(test_input))



```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Color counts:
{np.int64(0): 37, np.int64(8): 12}

Azure blocks:
[[(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6)], [(1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1)], [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)], [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]]

```

test input:
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 37
    - 8: 12
  objects:
    - size: 3x2, position: (0,5), color: azure
    - size: 3x2, position: (1,0), color: azure
    - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: azure
    - size: 2x2, position: (4,3), color: azure
    - size: 3x2, position: (5,1), color: azure

Based on the examples and the analysis of the test input,  the transformation rule is to add a blue pixel (1) adjacent to each azure (8) pixel or block.  The placement prioritizes locations that do not create larger blue blocks.

To generate the output, I will use the `set_pixel` function repeatedly, adding a blue (1) pixel next to each identified azure block, using the following logic:

1. **Identify Azure Blocks:**  Use the `find_azure_blocks` function (already defined above).

2. **Add Blue Pixels:** Iterate through the `azure_blocks`.  For each block, find an unoccupied adjacent cell and set its value to 1 using `set_pixel`. Prioritize positions that don't lead to larger blue blocks.

3. **Review and refine:** After each `set_pixel` operation, review the grid visually and make adjustments if necessary to maintain the pattern.


Now, I need the `set_pixel` and `initialize_output_from_input` functions to start building the output grid.  Please provide those functions.
