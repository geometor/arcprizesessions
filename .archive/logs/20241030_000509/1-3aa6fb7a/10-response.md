The code correctly identifies the azure blocks and attempts to place blue pixels adjacent to them.  The placement strategy prioritizes locations that don't create larger blue blocks.  The output grid reflects this.  I'm ready to submit this solution.  However, I still need the `submit` function to actually submit.  Please provide the definition for `submit`.  Once `submit` is defined, I can complete the code.
