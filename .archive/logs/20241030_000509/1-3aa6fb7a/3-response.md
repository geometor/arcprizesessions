The transformation adds a blue pixel (value 1) adjacent to each azure pixel (value 8) or block of azure pixels in the input grid to produce the output grid.  The placement of the new blue pixel isn't strictly consistent (sometimes above and to the right, sometimes just above or to the right), but it's always directly adjacent to at least one azure pixel.  The algorithm seems to prioritize placing the blue pixel to avoid creating a cluster of multiple blue pixels next to each other (if such a placement would create a 2x2 or larger block of blue pixels.)

Here's a summary of the observed patterns and differences using code to aid analysis:

```

The code identifies the locations of azure blocks.  The difference matrices show that a '1' (blue) is added adjacent to each azure block.  The placement strategy appears to be to add the blue pixel to an adjacent location that does not create a larger blue block.  In essence, the algorithm seeks to add the blue pixel in the most spatially "isolated" manner.
