The provided code is attempting to solve the puzzle by adding a blue pixel (value 1) next to each azure block (value 8) in the input grid. The strategy prioritizes adding the blue pixel to a location that doesn't create a larger blue block.  However, the code has a flaw: it modifies the `output_grid` in place, but the `set_pixel` function does not alter the underlying list of lists representation. It attempts to use NumPy array indexing with the list of lists which will throw an error.


To correct this, the `output_grid` should be a NumPy array, and the `set_pixel` function should correctly update the array.  Here's a corrected version:




code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

def find_azure_blocks(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    azure_blocks = []
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                block = []
                q = [(r, c)]
                while q:
                    curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)
                    if 0 <= curr_r < rows and 0 <= curr_c < cols and grid[curr_r, curr_c] == 8 and not visited[curr_r, curr_c]:
                        block.append((curr_r, curr_c))
                        visited[curr_r, curr_c] = True
                        q.extend([(curr_r + 1, curr_c), (curr_r - 1, curr_c), (curr_r, curr_c + 1), (curr_r, curr_c - 1)])
                azure_blocks.append(block)
    return azure_blocks

azure_blocks = find_azure_blocks(test_input)

output_grid = test_input.copy()

def set_pixel(grid, color, row, col):
    grid[row, col] = color

for block in azure_blocks:
    for r, c in block:
        #Attempt to place blue pixel to the right
        if c + 1 < output_grid.shape[1] and output_grid[r, c+1] == 0:
            set_pixel(output_grid, 1, r, c+1)
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r}, {c+1}) to 1")
            continue
        #Attempt to place blue pixel above
        if r -1 >= 0 and output_grid[r-1, c] == 0:
            set_pixel(output_grid, 1, r-1, c)
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r-1}, {c}) to 1")
            continue
        #Attempt to place blue pixel below
        if r + 1 < output_grid.shape[0] and output_grid[r+1, c] == 0:
            set_pixel(output_grid, 1, r+1, c)
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r+1}, {c}) to 1")
            continue
        #Attempt to place blue pixel to the left
        if c - 1 >= 0 and output_grid[r, c-1] == 0:
            set_pixel(output_grid, 1, r, c-1)
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r}, {c-1}) to 1")
            continue

print(f'{output_grid=}')


```

code_execution_result: 1

       [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8],
       [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0],
       [1, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

The corrected code now uses NumPy arrays and updates the `output_grid` correctly.  The `submit` function is still needed to send the solution.  I await instructions on how to proceed once that function is defined.
