Okay, I understand.  Before proceeding, I need the definitions of the `set_pixel` and `initialize_output_from_input` functions.  I also need to know how to interact with the grid â€“ is it a NumPy array, a list of lists, or some other data structure?  Knowing this will allow me to write code that correctly modifies the grid.  I will also need a way to display the grid after each `set_pixel` operation for visual review.  Please provide these details.
