There is no `initialize_output_from_input` function.  The grid is represented as a list of lists.  There's no built-in way to display the grid; you'll have to print it yourself.

Here's how we can proceed:

1.  **Initialization:** We'll create the output grid as a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Azure Block Identification:** The `find_azure_blocks` function from the previous analysis will be used.

3.  **Iterative Pixel Setting:** We'll iterate through the azure blocks and add blue pixels adjacent to them using `set_pixel`.

4.  **Submission:** Finally, we'll submit the completed grid.

Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

def find_azure_blocks(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    azure_blocks = []
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                block = []
                q = [(r, c)]
                while q:
                    curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)
                    if 0 <= curr_r < rows and 0 <= curr_c < cols and grid[curr_r, curr_c] == 8 and not visited[curr_r, curr_c]:
                        block.append((curr_r, curr_c))
                        visited[curr_r, curr_c] = True
                        q.extend([(curr_r + 1, curr_c), (curr_r - 1, curr_c), (curr_r, curr_c + 1), (curr_r, curr_c - 1)])
                azure_blocks.append(block)
    return azure_blocks

azure_blocks = find_azure_blocks(test_input)

output_grid = test_input.tolist()

for block in azure_blocks:
    for r, c in block:
        #Attempt to place blue pixel to the right
        if c + 1 < len(output_grid[0]) and output_grid[r][c+1] == 0:
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r}, {c+1}) to 1")
            set_pixel(1, c+1, r)
            continue
        #Attempt to place blue pixel above
        if r -1 >= 0 and output_grid[r-1][c] == 0:
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r-1}, {c}) to 1")
            set_pixel(1, c, r-1)
            continue
        #Attempt to place blue pixel below
        if r + 1 < len(output_grid) and output_grid[r+1][c] == 0:
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r+1}, {c}) to 1")
            set_pixel(1, c, r+1)
            continue
        #Attempt to place blue pixel to the left
        if c - 1 >= 0 and output_grid[r][c-1] == 0:
            print(f"Setting pixel at ({r}, {c-1}) to 1")
            set_pixel(1, c-1, r)
            continue

print(f'{output_grid=}')
print(submit())

```

Note:  This code assumes that `set_pixel` modifies the `output_grid` in place.  If it doesn't, you will need to adjust the code to update the `output_grid` accordingly.  Also,  error handling (e.g., checking for out-of-bounds indices) might be added for robustness.  Finally, the `submit` function is a placeholder; its actual behavior depends on the ARC-AGI system.
