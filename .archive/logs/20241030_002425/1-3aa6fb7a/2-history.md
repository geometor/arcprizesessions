## observations:

Here's an analysis of example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 5 azure (8) pixels forming a loose, irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (5)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Two blue (1) pixels appear, one above and to the right of a top azure pixel and one below and to the left of a bottom azure pixel.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue (1).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve the addition of two blue (1) pixels.  These are positioned diagonally adjacent to the topmost and bottommost azure (8) pixels in the input cluster. There's no obvious rule governing the exact placement beyond this adjacency, except for the location being diagonal.  It appears that the rule might be: *For each extreme point (topmost, bottommost, leftmost, rightmost) of the cluster of azure (8) pixels, add a blue (1) pixel diagonally adjacent to that extreme point.*  However, we need more examples to confirm or refute this hypothesis, especially to determine if the rule applies to leftmost and rightmost points too.

**Next steps:** More examples are needed to confirm the hypothesis of adding blue pixels diagonally adjacent to extreme points of the azure cluster.  If more examples show different behavior (e.g. adding blue pixels in another configuration, handling multiple clusters differently), the rule will need adjustment.
