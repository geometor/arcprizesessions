Here's an analysis of example_2, following the same format as example_1:

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 7 azure (8) pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (7)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Three blue (1) pixels appear, each diagonally adjacent to an extreme point of the azure cluster.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue (1).

**Transformation:**

This example further supports the hypothesis formed from example_1.  Again, blue (1) pixels are added diagonally adjacent to extreme points of the azure (8) cluster. This time, three extreme points (top, left, and bottom) have blue pixels added next to them diagonally.  The hypothesis remains: *For each extreme point (topmost, bottommost, leftmost, rightmost) of the cluster of azure (8) pixels, add a blue (1) pixel diagonally adjacent to that extreme point.*


**Comparison with Example 1 and Refined Hypothesis:**

Both examples show the addition of blue pixels diagonally adjacent to the extreme points of the azure clusters.  However, Example 1 only showed 2 added pixels while Example 2 showed 3.  This suggests the number of added blue pixels depends on the number of extreme points in the azure cluster (not necessarily all 4 points). The refined hypothesis is:

*Find the extreme points (topmost, bottommost, leftmost, rightmost) of the connected azure (8) pixel cluster(s).  For each extreme point, add a blue (1) pixel diagonally adjacent to it.  If multiple clusters exist, this transformation is applied independently to each cluster.*

**Next Steps:**  We need more examples to test this refined hypothesis.  Specifically, examples with:

*   More than one azure cluster.
*   Clusters with different shapes and numbers of extreme points (to see the relationship between the number of extreme points and the number of added blue pixels).
*   Clusters which share extreme points (to test if the blue pixel is added only once for each shared extreme point).
*   Cases where the extreme points are not clearly defined or the cluster is not simply connected.
*   A situation where an extreme point doesn't have an empty diagonal spot to put the blue pixel.  What will happen then?  Will it add somewhere else or does the rule not apply in this scenario?

The more diverse the test cases, the more robust our understanding of the rule will become.
