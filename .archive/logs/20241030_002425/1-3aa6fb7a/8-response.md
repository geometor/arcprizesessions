The previous code accurately identifies and processes multiple clusters. The last step of setting all values to 0 is unnecessary and incorrect.  The correct output should be the result of applying the transformation to the input.

Let's re-run the transformation using the improved code, and then submit that as the final output.


code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label

def find_extreme_points(grid):
    """Finds the extreme points of connected components in a grid."""
    labeled_grid, num_features = label(grid)
    extreme_points_all = []
    for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
        cluster_indices = np.where(labeled_grid == label_num)
        rows, cols = cluster_indices
        if not rows.size:
            continue
        min_row, max_row = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)
        min_col, max_col = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)
        extreme_points = [(min_row, min_col), (min_row, max_col), (max_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)]
        extreme_points_all.append(extreme_points)

    return extreme_points_all


def apply_transformation(input_grid):
    """Applies the transformation rule to the input grid."""
    grid_copy = np.copy(input_grid)
    all_extreme_points = find_extreme_points(grid_copy)
    for extreme_points in all_extreme_points:
        for point in extreme_points:
            row, col = point
            for dr, dc in [(-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= new_row < grid_copy.shape[0] and 0 <= new_col < grid_copy.shape[1] and grid_copy[new_row, new_col] == 0:
                    grid_copy[new_row, new_col] = 1
                    break  # Add only one blue pixel per extreme point

    return grid_copy

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

test_output = apply_transformation(test_input)
print(test_output)
```
code_execution_result: 1
```
[[0 0 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 1]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```

This is the final output.  The algorithm correctly identifies all clusters and adds blue pixels.
