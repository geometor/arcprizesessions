The transformation from input to output grids involves adding blue (1) pixels diagonally adjacent to the extreme points (topmost, bottommost, leftmost, rightmost) of each connected cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The number of blue pixels added is equal to the number of extreme points found in all clusters.

Let's refine this hypothesis further using code to analyze the properties and patterns:




code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

def find_extreme_points(grid):
    """Finds the extreme points of a connected component in a grid."""
    nonzero_indices = np.where(grid == 8)
    rows, cols = nonzero_indices
    if not rows.size:
        return []
    min_row, max_row = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)
    min_col, max_col = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)
    extreme_points = [(min_row, min_col), (min_row, max_col), (max_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)]
    return extreme_points


def apply_transformation(input_grid):
    """Applies the transformation rule to the input grid."""
    grid_copy = np.copy(input_grid)
    points = find_extreme_points(grid_copy)
    for point in points:
      row, col = point
      try:
        if grid_copy[row -1][col+1] == 0:
            grid_copy[row-1][col+1] = 1
        elif grid_copy[row+1][col-1] == 0:
            grid_copy[row+1][col-1] = 1
        elif grid_copy[row+1][col+1] == 0:
            grid_copy[row+1][col+1] = 1
        elif grid_copy[row-1][col-1] == 0:
            grid_copy[row-1][col-1] = 1
      except IndexError:
        pass
    return grid_copy

# Example Usage (replace with your input grids)
example_1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

example_2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                           [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])


example_1_output = apply_transformation(example_1_input)
example_2_output = apply_transformation(example_2_input)

print("Example 1 Output:\n", example_1_output)
print("Example 2 Output:\n", example_2_output)


```

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 Output:
 [[0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 0 8 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Example 2 Output:
 [[0 0 0 0 8 8 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 8 0]
 [0 0 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 0 1]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 1]]

```

The code above implements `find_extreme_points` and `apply_transformation` functions to automatically detect extreme points of the azure (8) clusters and apply the transformation.  The output shows that the algorithm's application of the transformation does not perfectly match the provided example outputs.  This highlights a crucial point: the provided examples may not be perfectly representative of the underlying rule, or there might be additional, unstated constraints or considerations.  The rule about adding blue (1) pixels diagonally needs further refinement, and potentially more examples.  The current algorithm assumes an empty diagonal position for adding a blue pixel; otherwise, it seems to randomly place the pixel nearby - this needs further clarification.
