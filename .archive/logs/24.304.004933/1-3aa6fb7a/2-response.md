Here's an analysis of example_2, building upon the observations from example_1:

**input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 10
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.
```

**output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 37
  - 8: 10
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s similar to input.
  - Three 1s (blue pixels) added, seemingly outlining the cluster.
```

**differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '0's changed to '1's (blue).
```

**transformation:**

The transformation in example_2 further supports the hypothesis from example_1.  It appears that blue pixels ('1') are added to locations adjacent to, and seemingly outlining, the cluster of light blue pixels ('8').  The placement isn't perfectly consistent with a simple "min/max" coordinate rule, suggesting a more nuanced algorithm, potentially related to the edges or boundary of the '8' cluster.  Let's refine the hypothesis:

**Refined Hypothesis:**  Blue pixels ('1') are added to positions directly adjacent to the exterior of the '8' cluster.  The number and position depend on the shape of the cluster and the number of "exposed" edges.

**Further Investigation Needed:**

To confidently confirm this hypothesis (or discover a different, more accurate one), more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples with:

* **Different cluster shapes:**  Exploring various cluster shapes (e.g., different sized squares, long lines, circular) would help clarify if the placement of '1's follows a consistent pattern relative to the cluster's boundary.
* **Cluster sizes:** Testing with clusters of varying sizes will help rule out coincidental placement.
* **Clusters with different numbers of external edges:** Clusters with more or less "exposed" edges will test whether the positioning of the '1's is dependent on how open the cluster is on the edges.
* **Clusters touching the edges of the grid:** To explore what happens when there is no room for additional pixels outside of the cluster.
