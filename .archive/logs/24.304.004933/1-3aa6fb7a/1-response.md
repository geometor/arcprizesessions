Here's an analysis of example_1:

**input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s similar to input.
  - Two 1s (blue pixels) appear where the 8 cluster ends (bottom right and top middle)
```

**differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '8's changed to '1's (blue).
```

**transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue pixels ('1') to the locations where the cluster of light blue pixels ('8') ends. The addition seems to  "outline" the cluster in a way.  It might be related to the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the cluster.  Let's call the cluster coordinates  (x, y).  The new blue pixels might appear at the max X (rightmost) and min Y (topmost) points of the cluster of '8's.  It's also possible this is incorrect, as the cluster's outline isn't fully described by this.  Additional examples are needed to confirm this or explore alternative hypotheses.
