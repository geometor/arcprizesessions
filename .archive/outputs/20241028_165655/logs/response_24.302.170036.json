The yellow and magenta cells move down.\n- It seems like there is an underlying rule of moving the color down to fill the bottom row, but I'll need more examples to confirm this.\n\n\n## Example 2\n\n**Input:**\n\n- Width: 6\n- Height: 6\n- Colors:\n  - White: 17\n  - Yellow: 3\n  - Azure: 2\n  - Orange: 2\n  - Maroon: 1\n- Objects:\n  - White (0, 0)\n  - White (0, 1)\n  - White (0, 2)\n  - White (0, 3)\n  - White (0, 4)\n  - Maroon (0, 5)\n  - White (1, 0)\n  - White (1, 1)\n  - White (1, 2)\n  - Azure (1, 3)\n  - White (1, 4)\n  - White (1, 5)\n  - White (2, 0)\n  - White (2, 1)\n  - White (2, 2)\n  - White (2, 3)\n  - White (2, 4)\n  - White (2, 5)\n  - Yellow (3, 0)\n  - White (3, 1)\n  - White (3, 2)\n  - White (3, 3)\n  - White (3, 4)\n  - White (3, 5)\n  - Yellow (4, 0)\n  - White (4, 1)\n  - Orange (4, 2)\n  - Azure (4, 3)\n  - White (4, 4)\n  - White (4, 5)\n  - Yellow (5, 0)\n  - White (5, 1)\n  - Orange (5, 2)\n  - White (5, 3)\n  - White (5, 4)\n  - White (5, 5)\n\n**Output:**\n\n- Width: 6\n- Height: 6\n- Colors:\n  - White: 17\n  - Yellow: 3\n  - Azure: 2\n  - Orange: 2\n  - Maroon: 1\n- Objects:\n  - White (0, 0)\n  - White (0, 1)\n  - White (0, 2)\n  - White (0, 3)\n  - White (0, 4)\n  - White (0, 5)\n  - White (1, 0)\n  - White (1, 1)\n  - White (1, 2)\n  - White (1, 3)\n  - White (1, 4)\n  - White (1, 5)\n  - White (2, 0)\n  - White (2, 1)\n  - White (2, 2)\n  - White (2, 3)\n  - White (2, 4)\n  - White (2, 5)\n  - Yellow (3, 0)\n  - White (3, 1)\n  - White (3, 2)\n  - White (3, 3)\n  - White (3, 4)\n  - White (3, 5)\n  - Yellow (4, 0)\n  - White (4, 1)\n  - Orange (4, 2)\n  - Azure (4, 3)\n  - White (4, 4)\n  - White (4, 5)\n  - Yellow (5, 0)\n  - White (5, 1)\n  - Orange (5, 2)\n  - Azure (5, 3)\n  - White (5, 4)\n  - Maroon (5, 5)\n\n**Differences:**\n\n- Cells Changed: 1\n- Colors Changed: Maroon\n\n**Transformation:**\n\n- The maroon cell seems to have moved from the top row to the bottom row.\n- Everything else appears unchanged.\n\nI need to continue reviewing more examples to see if this is a consistent rule for all of the puzzles in this set.\n\nPlease provide the next example so I can further refine my understanding of the transformation rules.\n\n",
