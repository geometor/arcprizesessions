The agent should remove one azure pixel that is not directly adjacent to a blue pixel. \n\n**The agent needs to correct the working output grid and submit the correct solution.**\n\n\nThe transformation rule is to:\n\n- Add a blue pixel to the upper-right corner of each azure rectangle.\n- Remove one azure pixel that is not directly adjacent to a blue pixel.\n\nHere's how the agent can correct the working output grid:\n\n1. **Remove one azure pixel:**  The only azure pixels that do not have a blue pixel immediately to their right are at row 2, column 0 and at row 5, column 0.
