    "## Summary of Observations:\n\nBased on the three examples, here's a summary of the key observations and a refined hypothesis:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n- **Size Reduction:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid. The width and height are reduced by a factor of 3.\n- **Irrelevant Gray Block:** The gray block in the input grid is consistently irrelevant and never appears in the output grid.\n- **Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels appear in the output grid and seem to correspond to blue pixels in the input grid, specifically in the middle positions.\n- **White Pixel Preservation:** White pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.\n- **Blue Pixel Transformation:** Some blue pixels transform into red pixels, while others are discarded.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation involves reducing the input grid size by a factor of 3. Some blue pixels are transformed into red pixels, placed strategically in the center of each row or column in the output grid. White pixels are preserved, and the gray block is completely disregarded. \n\n## Code Execution:\n\n\n",

    "The code execution confirms that the number of blue pixels in each input grid is not equal to the number of red pixels in the corresponding output grid.

This selection is not based on the total number of blue pixels. \n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo understand the selection logic, we need to examine the positioning of the blue pixels in the input grid and the red pixels in the output grid. We will analyze the examples further to determine if there's a pattern in the relative locations of these pixels.\n\n",
