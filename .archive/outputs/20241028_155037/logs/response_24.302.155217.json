The patterns are symmetrical.\n- The blue pixel is in the lower right corner of a 3x3 grid of cells, while the orange pixels surround it.\n- The red pixel is not in a corner of a grid of cells, but the yellow pixels are surrounding it.\n\n**Overall:**\n\n- The transformation adds new colors and patterns to the grid based on the existing red and blue pixels.  The location of the pixels and the patterns that are created are consistent.\n- It seems that the new colors are added to the grid based on the position of the original color. \n\n",

Here are my observations:\n\n**Input:**\n\n- width: 9\n- height: 9\n- colors:\n  - white: 74\n  - azure: 1\n  - red: 2\n  - blue: 2\n- objects:\n  - an azure pixel at [0, 3]\n  - two red pixels at [2, 6] and [7, 0]\n  - two blue pixels at [3, 2] and [6, 6]\n\n**Output:**\n\n- width: 9\n- height: 9\n- colors:\n  - white: 64\n  - azure: 1\n  - red: 2\n  - blue: 2\n  - yellow: 8\n  - orange: 8\n- objects:\n  - an azure pixel at [0, 3]\n  - two red pixels at [2, 6] and [7, 0]\n  - two blue pixels at [3, 2] and [6, 6]\n  - a group of 8 yellow pixels, 2 in each row at [1, 5], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 8], [7, 0], [7, 2], [8, 0], [8, 2]\n  - a group of 8 orange pixels, 2 in each row at [2, 2], [2, 4], [3, 0], [3, 6], [5, 6], [5, 8], [6, 0], [6, 4] \n\n**Differences:**\n\n- cells_changed: 16\n- colors_changed: added yellow, orange\n\n**Transformation:**\n\n- The transformation adds yellow pixels around the red pixels and orange pixels around the blue pixels. \n- The patterns are symmetrical around the red and blue pixels. \n- The patterns are not always squares; they can be rectangles, in which case they are elongated vertically. \n\n**Overall:**\n\n- This example builds on the previous example by adding more complexity. It is consistent with the previous example.\n- The transformation adds new colors and patterns to the grid based on the existing red and blue pixels.  The location of the pixels and the patterns that are created are consistent.\n- It seems that the new colors are added to the grid based on the position of the original color. \n- The yellow pixels are added in a pattern that is slightly off-center in relation to the red pixels, and the orange pixels are added in a pattern that is slightly off-center in relation to the blue pixels. \n- The patterns seem to be influenced by the location of other pixels in the grid.  For example, in the case of the blue pixel at [3, 2], the orange pixels that are added are offset slightly from the blue pixel, likely because the azure pixel at [0, 3] is also influencing the pattern.\n- The patterns appear to grow outward from the red and blue pixels.\n- The transformation seems to be symmetrical, in that the same pattern of pixels is added around each of the red and blue pixels."
