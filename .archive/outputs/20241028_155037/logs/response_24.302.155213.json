The patterns are symmetrical.\n- The blue pixel is in the lower right corner of a 3x3 grid of cells, while the orange pixels surround it.\n- The red pixel is not in a corner of a grid of cells, but the yellow pixels are surrounding it.\n\n**Overall:**\n\n- The transformation adds new colors and patterns to the grid based on the existing red and blue pixels.  The location of the pixels and the patterns that are created are consistent.\n- It seems that the new colors are added to the grid based on the position of the original color. \n"
