    "The transformation of the input to output grid appears to be a simple color replacement, where each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid.  The relationship between the input and output colors is not a simple increment, but rather a more complex mapping. \n\nThe pattern for the color replacement can be described as follows:\n\n- For all colors except red, the output color is determined by subtracting 1 from the input color.\n- For red, the output color is determined by adding 4 to the input color.\n\nHere is a summary of the observations from the examples:\n\n- **Example 1:**\n  - The input colors are green, blue, and red.\n  - The output colors are yellow, gray, and magenta.\n  - All colors are incremented by 1.\n- **Example 2:**\n  - The input colors are red, green, and azure.\n  - The output colors are magenta, yellow, and maroon.\n  - The output color is determined by subtracting 1 from the input color for red and green, but adding 5 to the input color for azure.\n- **Example 3:**\n  - The input colors are gray, azure, and magenta.\n  - The output colors are blue, maroon, and red.\n  - The output color is determined by subtracting 4 from the input color for gray and magenta, but subtracting 4 and adding 5 for azure.\n- **Example 4:**\n  - The input colors are maroon, yellow, and red.\n  - The output colors are azure, green, and magenta.\n  - The output color is determined by subtracting 1 from the input color for maroon and yellow, but adding 4 to the input color for red.\n\nBased on the observations from the examples, the transformation rule is confirmed.
