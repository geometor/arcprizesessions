It suggests that the transformation in this puzzle might be very specific and potentially different from what we observed in the previous examples. \n\n**Possible hypotheses for the transformation:**\n\n- **No change:** Perhaps the output is simply a duplicate of the input.\n- **Hidden pattern:** There might be a complex pattern involving the locations of azure objects and the surrounding white cells, but it's not immediately apparent. \n- **Random change:** It's also possible that the transformation is random or introduces minimal, insignificant changes. \n\n**Next steps:**\n\nI'll require further examples to understand this transformation.

The blue pixels are added to the right of each azure object if the azure object is on the left side of the grid and to the left of each azure object if the azure object is on the right side of the grid.\n\nI'm also noticing a trend in the placement of the blue pixels in relation to white cells. It appears that blue pixels are only added in positions where they are adjacent to a white cell.\n\nI will use the `code_execution` tool to investigate the presence of white cells around azure objects.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(f'input_grid:\\n{input_grid}')\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\ninput_grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n```\nThe code execution shows the grid. The code will be useful to analyze the relationship between azure objects and white cells. \n\n**Possible hypotheses for the transformation:**\n\n- **Blue pixels are added to the right of azure objects if they are on the left side of the grid and to the left of azure objects if they are on the right side of the grid.**\n- **Blue pixels are only added in positions where they are adjacent to a white cell.**\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nI'll verify these hypotheses by applying the transformation rules to the test input grid and examining the results.\n\n## initialize the working output grid\nfunction_call:\ninitialize_output_from_input\n\nresult:\ninitialize_output_from_input()\n# working output grid\nupdated with your changes\n[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n\n<start_of_image> Schematic of the above grid:\n\n \n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 2 x 2  \n    -  Position:  (5,5) \n    -  Cells:  (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 2 x 2  \n    -  Position:  (0,0) \n    -  Cells:  (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (6,1) \n    -  Cells:  (6,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,6) \n    -  Cells:  (0,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (1,0) \n    -  Cells:  (1,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,1) \n    -  Cells:  (0,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (5,0) \n    -  Cells:  (5,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (6,0) \n    -  Cells:  (6,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (1,6) \n    -  Cells:  (1,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,5) \n    -  Cells:  (0,5) \n\nThe working output grid has been initialized.\nLet's proceed to update the grid based on the transformation rules we identified!\n\nselect the next function to update the working grid\nwhen you think you have completed the output, call the submit function\n- take a moment to review that the changes are in keeping with the rule\n- use code_execution to investigate properties\n\n\n",

It might be due to the absence of azure objects meeting the conditions for adding blue pixels. \n\n**Test Input:**\n- The test input grid has multiple azure objects, some on the left and some on the right side of the grid. \n\n**Rumination Phase:**\n\nThe examples and test input suggest that the transformation rule is:\n\n- **For each azure object on the left side of the grid:**\n    - Add a blue pixel to its right, only if there is a white cell adjacent to the right of the azure object. \n- **For each azure object on the right side of the grid:**\n    - Add a blue pixel to its left, only if there is a white cell adjacent to the left of the azure object. \n\nTo confirm this hypothesis and to ensure that I understand the transformation correctly, I will use the `code_execution` tool to analyze the input and output grids in detail.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(f'input_grid:\\n{input_grid}')\n\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\ninput_grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n```\nThe code execution shows the input grid. Now I will analyze the input grid to identify azure objects and their positions, and check the surrounding white cells to determine if the conditions for adding a blue pixel are met.\n\n- **Azure object at (0, 0):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is a white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (0, 1):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is a white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (0, 5):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is a white cell to the right of it. \n- **Azure object at (0, 6):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is no white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (1, 0):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is no white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (1, 6):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is no white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (5, 0):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is no white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (5, 5):** This object is on the right side of the grid. There is a white cell to the left of it.\n- **Azure object at (6, 0):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is no white cell to the right of it.\n- **Azure object at (6, 1):** This object is on the left side of the grid. There is no white cell to the right of it.\n\nBased on the analysis, the following azure objects meet the conditions for adding a blue pixel:\n\n- Azure object at (0, 0)\n- Azure object at (0, 1)\n- Azure object at (0, 5)\n- Azure object at (5, 5)\n\nNow let's use the `code_execution` tool to update the working output grid based on these findings.\n\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nworking_output_grid[0, 1] = 1 # add blue pixel to the right of azure object at (0, 0)\nworking_output_grid[0, 2] = 1 # add blue pixel to the right of azure object at (0, 1)\nworking_output_grid[0, 6] = 1 # add blue pixel to the right of azure object at (0, 5)\nworking_output_grid[5, 4] = 1 # add blue pixel to the left of azure object at (5, 5)\n\nprint(f'working_output_grid:\\n{working_output_grid}')\n\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nworking_output_grid:\n[[0 1 1 0 0 8 1]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 1 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n```\nThe code execution shows the updated working output grid, which now includes blue pixels in the locations identified as meeting the transformation rule.\n\n- **Azure object at (0, 0):** A blue pixel has been added to its right.\n- **Azure object at (0, 1):** A blue pixel has been added to its right.\n- **Azure object at (0, 5):** A blue pixel has been added to its right.\n- **Azure object at (5, 5):** A blue pixel has been added to its left.\n\nNow I will visually review the updated working output grid to confirm the changes and ensure they are in line with the transformation rule.\n\nBased on the updated grid, we can see that all azure objects that met the conditions for adding a blue pixel have been updated accordingly.  \n\nI believe that this grid represents the final output grid.\n\nfunction_call:\nsubmit\n\nselect the next function to update the working grid\nwhen you think you have completed the output, call the submit function\nfunction_call:\nsubmit\n\n# working output grid\nupdated with your changes\n[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n\n<start_of_image> Schematic of the above grid:\n\n \n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 2 x 2  \n    -  Position:  (5,5) \n    -  Cells:  (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 2 x 2  \n    -  Position:  (0,0) \n    -  Cells:  (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (6,1) \n    -  Cells:  (6,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,6) \n    -  Cells:  (0,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (1,0) \n    -  Cells:  (1,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,1) \n    -  Cells:  (0,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (5,0) \n    -  Cells:  (5,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (6,0) \n    -  Cells:  (6,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (1,6) \n    -  Cells:  (1,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,5) \n    -  Cells:  (0,5) \n\n- take a moment to review that the changes are in keeping with the rule\n- use code_execution to investigate properties\n\n\nselect the next function to update the working grid\nwhen you think you have completed the output, call the submit function\nThe output grid is identical to the input grid! This means that the transformation rule is not applicable in this case.\n\nWe've seen this before with Example 3, where the transformation rule was not applied.  \n\nThis suggests that the rule is very specific and only applies to certain configurations of azure objects and surrounding white cells.  \n\nLet's try a different approach to identify the transformation rule.  \n\nInstead of focusing on the placement of blue pixels, let's consider the azure objects themselves.  \n\nI've noticed that the azure objects in the output grid are often shifted or rearranged in comparison to the input grid.  \n\nPerhaps the transformation rule involves manipulating the azure objects in some way, rather than simply adding blue pixels. \n\nLet's explore this hypothesis further by examining the examples and the test input. \n\nDo you want to review another example or proceed to the rumination phase? \n\n# working output grid\nupdated with your changes\n[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n\n<start_of_image> Schematic of the above grid:\n\n \n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 2 x 2  \n    -  Position:  (5,5) \n    -  Cells:  (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 2 x 2  \n    -  Position:  (0,0) \n    -  Cells:  (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (6,1) \n    -  Cells:  (6,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,6) \n    -  Cells:  (0,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (1,0) \n    -  Cells:  (1,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,1) \n    -  Cells:  (0,1)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (5,0) \n    -  Cells:  (5,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (6,0) \n    -  Cells:  (6,0)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (1,6) \n    -  Cells:  (1,6)\n  - **Azure Object:**  \n    -  Size: 1 x 1  \n    -  Position:  (0,5) \n    -  Cells:  (0,5) \n\n- take a moment to review that the changes are in keeping with the rule\n- use code_execution to investigate properties\n\n"
