It seems the transformation can be explained by these observations:\n\n- **Red Pixels**:  When a red pixel is present, a symmetric pattern of yellow pixels appears around it.  This pattern is two yellow pixels per row, forming a 2x2 rectangle.\n- **Blue Pixels**: When a blue pixel is present, a symmetric pattern of orange pixels appears around it.

For example, the blue pixel in example 1 is in the lower right corner of a 3x3 grid of cells, while the orange pixels surround it. In example 2, the red pixel is at the edge of a 3x3 grid, causing the yellow rectangle to be offset slightly. \n\nI will need to consider these factors when determining the location and size of the yellow and orange rectangles for the test input.\n\nI believe I can successfully predict the output for a new test input.\n\n",
