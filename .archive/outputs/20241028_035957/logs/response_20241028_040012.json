  "response_text": "Please provide me with the input and output grids. I need to see the actual examples to analyze the transformation and provide a summary. \n\nOnce you provide the grids, I can:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grids:**  I'll examine the color distribution, object shapes, and their positions in both the input and output grids. \n2.  **Identify Differences:**  I'll note the changes in color, position, and shape between the two grids. \n3.  **Generate Code:** I'll use python tools like `numpy` to help me analyze patterns and quantify changes. \n4.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Based on the observations, I'll propose a hypothesis about the transformation rules.\n\nPlease share the grids so I can start working on this! \n",
