You want me to review example input and output grids, identify differences, and extract patterns that describe the transformation from the input grid to the output grid. \n\nLet's analyze the provided examples.\n\n## Example 1\n\n**Input Grid**\n\n- width: 7\n- height: 7\n- colors:\n    - 0: (42) - white\n    - 8: (5) - azure\n- objects:\n    - size: 2x2, position: (1, 1), color: azure\n    - size: 2x2, position: (3, 4), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (4, 5), color: azure\n\n**Output Grid**\n\n- width: 7\n- height: 7\n- colors:\n    - 0: (41) - white\n    - 1: (1) - blue\n    - 8: (5) - azure\n- objects:\n    - size: 2x2, position: (1, 1), color: azure\n    - size: 2x2, position: (3, 4), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (4, 5), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (1, 2), color: blue\n    - size: 1x1, position: (4, 4), color: blue\n\n- differences:\n    - cells_changed: 2\n    - colors_changed: added blue\n- transformation:\n    - The blue color appears in the upper right corner of each azure object.\n    - The blue color appears in the lower left corner of each azure object. \n\n## Example 2\n\n**Input Grid**\n\n- width: 7\n- height: 7\n- colors:\n    - 0: (35) - white\n    - 8: (12) - azure\n- objects:\n    - size: 2x2, position: (0, 4), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (1, 5), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (2, 2), color: azure\n    - size: 2x2, position: (3, 2), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (5, 4), color: azure\n    - size: 2x2, position: (6, 2), color: azure\n\n**Output Grid**\n\n- width: 7\n- height: 7\n- colors:\n    - 0: (34) - white\n    - 1: (4) - blue\n    - 8: (12) - azure\n- objects:\n    - size: 2x2, position: (0, 4), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (1, 5), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (2, 2), color: azure\n    - size: 2x2, position: (3, 2), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (5, 4), color: azure\n    - size: 2x2, position: (6, 2), color: azure\n    - size: 1x1, position: (1, 4), color: blue\n    - size: 1x1, position: (2, 3), color: blue\n    - size: 1x1, position: (5, 3), color: blue\n    - size: 1x1, position: (6, 3), color: blue\n\n- differences:\n    - cells_changed: 4\n    - colors_changed: added blue\n- transformation:\n    - The blue color appears in the upper right corner of each azure object. \n    - The blue color appears in the lower left corner of each azure object. \n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- Both examples demonstrate that the transformation involves adding blue pixels to the input grid.\n- The placement of the blue pixels is consistent across both examples.\n-  A blue pixel is added to the upper right corner of each azure object.\n-  A blue pixel is added to the lower left corner of each azure object.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n- The examples are limited, so we need more data to verify if these patterns consistently hold for other scenarios.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Review more examples to validate the observed patterns.\n- Examine other possible transformations related to the positions of the blue pixels. \n- Consider if there are any other factors (e.g., object size) that could influence the transformation.\n- Analyze the position of the blue pixels relative to the azure objects.\n\nThe next step is to present me with more examples, and I will continue to refine my understanding of the transformation rules.\n\n",

This pattern is consistent regardless of the object's size or location.\n* **No Other Changes:** Aside from the addition of the blue pixels, the output grids remain identical to the input grids. This suggests that the transformation focuses solely on the azure objects.\n\nI'm still curious to know if there are other patterns related to the position of the blue pixels. I would like to see more examples to further validate my observations and explore any exceptions. \n"
