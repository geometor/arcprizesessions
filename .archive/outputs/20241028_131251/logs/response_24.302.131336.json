    "# examples summary: \n",
    "The transformation rule appears to be: **Add a blue pixel to the upper-right and lower-left corners of each azure object in the input grid.** \n\nHere's what I've observed:\n\n* **Consistent Pattern:**  The examples consistently add a blue pixel to the upper-right and lower-left corners of every azure object in the input grid. This pattern is consistent regardless of the object's size or location.\n* **No Other Changes:** Aside from the addition of the blue pixels, the output grids remain identical to the input grids. This suggests that the transformation focuses solely on the azure objects.\n\nI'm still curious to know if there are other patterns related to the position of the blue pixels. I would like to see more examples to further validate my observations and explore any exceptions. \n\n",
