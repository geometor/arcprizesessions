    - width: 3
    - height: 3
    - colors:
        - green: 3
        - blue: 3
        - red: 3
    - objects:
        - green rectangle: 3x3 
        - blue rectangle: 3x3 
        - red rectangle: 3x3

    - objects:
        - yellow rectangle: 3x3 
        - gray rectangle: 3x3 
        - magenta rectangle: 3x3
- differences:
    - cells_changed: 9
    - colors_changed: each color in input changed to the next color in the sequence
- transformation:
    - the input colors are each replaced by the next color in the sequence
    - 3 -> 4
    - 1 -> 5
    - 2 -> 6

Is there more information on the sequence of colors in the puzzle?


# example_2

## output:

[[6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]]

## observations:

The sequence of colors appears to be a simple cycle - the color with value 9 is followed by the color with value 0, which in turn is followed by the color with value 1, etc.

    - cells_changed: 9
    - colors_changed: each color in input changed to the next color in the sequence
- transformation:
    - the input colors are each replaced by the next color in the sequence
    - 5 -> 1
    - 8 -> 9
    - 6 -> 2

The sequence of colors appears to be a simple cycle - the color with value 9 is followed by the color with value 0, which in turn is followed by the color with value 1, etc.  


# example_4

## input:

[[9 4 2]
 [9 4 2]
 [9 4 2]]

## output:

[[8 3 6]
 [8 3 6]
 [8 3 6]]

## observations:

I noticed that the sequence of colors is a simple cycle. This means the color with value 9 is followed by the color with value 0, which in turn is followed by the color with value 1, and so on. 

For example:

- In example 1, the colors 3, 1, and 2 are replaced by 4, 5, and 6 respectively.
- In example 2, the colors 2, 3, and 8 are replaced by 6, 4, and 9 respectively.
- In example 3, the colors 5, 8, and 6 are replaced by 1, 9, and 2 respectively. 
- In example 4, the colors 9, 4, and 2 are replaced by 8, 3, and 6 respectively. 

Therefore, the transformation rule is to replace each color in the input grid with the next color in the sequence. 

## example_4 observations:
- input:
    - width: 3
    - height: 3
    - colors:
        - maroon: 3
        - yellow: 3
        - red: 3
    - objects:
        - maroon rectangle: 3x3
        - yellow rectangle: 3x3
        - red rectangle: 3x3
- output:
    - width: 3
    - height: 3
    - colors:
        - azure: 3
        - green: 3
        - magenta: 3
    - objects:
        - azure rectangle: 3x3
        - green rectangle: 3x3
        - magenta rectangle: 3x3
- differences:
    - cells_changed: 9
    - colors_changed: each color in input changed to the next color in the sequence
- transformation:
    - the input colors are each replaced by the next color in the sequence
    - 9 -> 8
    - 4 -> 3
    - 2 -> 6

I have successfully identified the transformation pattern.

Let's move on to the test phase.
