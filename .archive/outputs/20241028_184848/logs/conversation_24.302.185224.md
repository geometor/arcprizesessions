The output grid has the colors: white, yellow, red, and blue.

**input:**
  - width: 4

    - white: 10
    - yellow: 2
    - red: 1
    - blue: 1
  - objects:
    - yellow: 2x1 block in top row
    - yellow: 2x1 block in 3rd row
    - red: 1x1 block in top row
    - blue: 1x1 block in bottom row

  - objects:
    - yellow: 2x1 block in 3rd row
    - red: 1x1 block in bottom row
    - blue: 1x1 block in bottom row
**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 4
  - colors_changed:  yellow and red moved to bottom row
**transformation:**
  - move colored objects from top and middle rows to bottom row

This rule is very specific. There are a few key items:
  - Only the colored blocks are moved.
  - Only the blocks in the top and middle rows are moved.
  - The blocks are moved to the bottom row in the same relative position as the top and middle row blocks

I will test these rules with additional examples.

The transformation pattern appears to be consistent between these 2 examples.  It appears that all non-white objects are moved to the bottom row of the grid from the top and middle rows.  All other objects remain stationary.  I will continue to test this pattern with additional examples.

**transformation:**

This transformation is consistent with previous examples. I have noticed the following:
  - The transformation of objects is based on row.
  - All non-white objects are moved down one row, except for objects on the bottom row which are left as is.
  - White objects are not affected by the transformation.

I will continue to test this pattern with additional examples.

# examples summary: 

- summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output

- use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids

## Response

The transformation pattern appears to be consistent across the 3 examples provided.

- The transformation is based on row.
- All non-white objects are moved down one row, except for objects on the bottom row which are left as is.
- White objects are not affected by the transformation.

Example 3 - row 0 - column 3 - failed: input 1 - output 0
Example 3 - row 2 - column 4 - failed: input 2 - output 0

```

The code execution output indicates that the transformation rule I derived does not hold for all examples.

There are 2 issues: 
- The code execution assumes that all non-white objects on rows 0-3 are moved down one row, however in example 2, the azure objects are moved down 3 rows, not 1.
- The code execution assumes that all non-white objects are moved. However, in example 2 the azure objects are moved down 3 rows, however, the orange objects remain in place.

I need to re-examine the examples for more clues.

Let's see if we can discern any additional rules:

**Possible Rules**

- **Non-white object movement:** 
    - Objects are moved down one row.
    - Objects on the bottom row are left as is.
    - Objects on the top row are moved down one row.
    - Objects on the second row are moved down one row.

- **White object movement:** 
    - All white objects are left as is.

**Attributes**

- The size of the grid
- The number of colors in the grid
- The position of the colors in the grid
- The shape of the objects in the grid
- The number of objects in the grid

**Combining Rules**

- **Rule 1: Non-white object movement** - Objects are moved down one row.
- **Rule 2: White object movement** - All white objects are left as is.

**Possible New Rule**
- **Rule 3: Non-white object movement based on row** - Objects on even numbered rows are moved down one row, objects on odd numbered rows are moved down two rows, and objects on the bottom row are left as is.

The rule I previously derived does not hold for all examples.
I need to re-examine the examples for more clues.

I need to look more deeply into what factors might determine the downward movement.

    - The blue and red objects are moved down one row from the first and third rows.

It appears that the number of rows moved is not consistent based on the row the object is in.
