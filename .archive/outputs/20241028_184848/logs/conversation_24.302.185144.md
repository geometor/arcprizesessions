The input grid has the colors: white, yellow, red, and blue. 
The output grid has the colors: white, yellow, red, and blue.

**input:**
  - width: 4
  - height: 4
  - colors:
    - white: 10
    - yellow: 2
    - red: 1
    - blue: 1
  - objects:
    - yellow: 2x1 block in top row
    - yellow: 2x1 block in 3rd row
    - red: 1x1 block in top row
    - blue: 1x1 block in bottom row
**output:**
  - width: 4
  - height: 4
  - colors:
    - white: 12
    - yellow: 2
    - red: 1
    - blue: 1
  - objects:
    - yellow: 2x1 block in 3rd row
    - red: 1x1 block in bottom row
    - blue: 1x1 block in bottom row
**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 4
  - colors_changed:  yellow and red moved to bottom row
**transformation:**
  - move colored objects from top and middle rows to bottom row

This rule is very specific. There are a few key items:
  - Only the colored blocks are moved.
  - Only the blocks in the top and middle rows are moved.
  - The blocks are moved to the bottom row in the same relative position as the top and middle row blocks

I will test these rules with additional examples.

## observations:

- review the example grids

- check for differences and patterns


## Response

code_execution:

```python

import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],

                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
                     [4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]])

output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                     [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9]])

print(f'input: {input_grid}')

The input grid has the colors: white, azure, orange, yellow, and red. 
The output grid has the colors: white, azure, orange, yellow, and red.

**input:**
  - width: 6
  - height: 6
  - colors:
    - white: 28
    - azure: 2
    - orange: 2
    - yellow: 3
    - red: 1
  - objects:
    - yellow: 3x1 block in left column
    - azure: 1x1 block in 2nd row
    - orange: 2x1 block in 5th row
    - azure: 1x1 block in 5th row
    - red: 1x1 block in top row
**output:**
  - width: 6
  - height: 6
  - colors:
    - white: 27
    - azure: 2
    - orange: 2
    - yellow: 3
    - red: 1
  - objects:
    - yellow: 3x1 block in left column
    - azure: 1x1 block in 5th row
    - orange: 2x1 block in 5th row
    - azure: 1x1 block in 5th row
    - red: 1x1 block in bottom row
**differences:**
  - cells_changed: 1
  - colors_changed:  red moved to bottom row
**transformation:**
  - move the red block from the top row to the bottom row

The transformation pattern appears to be consistent between these 2 examples.  It appears that all non-white objects are moved to the bottom row of the grid from the top and middle rows.  All other objects remain stationary.  I will continue to test this pattern with additional examples.
