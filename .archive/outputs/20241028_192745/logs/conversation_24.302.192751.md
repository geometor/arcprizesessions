- check for differences and patterns


## Response

## Example 1 Observations:

**Input:**
* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: 44
    - 8: 5
* objects:
    - Two azure objects. One 2x1 in the top left. Another L shaped object in the bottom right made of 3 pixels.

**Output:**
* width: 7
* height: 7
* colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 1: 2
    - 8: 5
* objects:
    - Two azure objects (same as input). Two new blue pixels.

**Differences:**
* cells_changed: 2
* colors_changed: Two white (0) pixels changed to blue (1).

**Transformation:**
* It appears that white (0) pixels directly to the right of the top-most azure (8) pixel in any connected object changes to blue (1). This rule correctly describes the changes in this example. Let's see if more examples support it.
