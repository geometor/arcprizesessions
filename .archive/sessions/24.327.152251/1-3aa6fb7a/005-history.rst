**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some azure pixels are replaced by blue (1) pixels.  The replacement seems to occur at the edges or periphery of the azure cluster.



code_execution:

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

**observations**



The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels in an irregular, roughly L-shaped pattern. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels on the outer edges of the cluster have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at indices: {diff}")
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Analyzing the location of changes
   for i in range(changed_cells):
     row = diff[0][i]
     col = diff[1][i]
     print(f"Cell at row {row}, column {col} changed from {input_grid[row,col]} to {output_grid[row,col]}")

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the perimeter of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The transformation in example 2 is similar to example 1.  Again, some (but not all) azure pixels at the outer edges of the azure cluster are replaced with blue pixels. The number of changes seems somewhat arbitrary; it's not a consistent number across examples.  A more precise rule determining *which* edge pixels are changed is needed.  More examples would help to clarify.



**examples summary**



Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve changing a subset of the outermost azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels are changed isn't strictly defined by a simple geometric rule (like "all outer pixels").  It seems to be a partial, somewhat arbitrary replacement of edge pixels.  The number of changed pixels varies between examples (2 in example 1, 3 in example 2).  The overall shape of the azure cluster is largely preserved.

To further investigate and potentially refine this hypothesis, more examples are needed to discern if there's a hidden pattern determining which edge pixels are selected for transformation.  A more rigorous analysis might involve examining the adjacency relationships of the pixels and looking for consistent local patterns around pixels that are modified.  For instance, is there a preference for changing azure pixels that are adjacent to white (0) pixels?

The code above analyzes the neighbors of the changed pixels.  In both examples, some of the changed pixels are surrounded by at least one white pixel and one or more azure pixels.  However, this analysis isn't conclusive without more examples.  A more sophisticated approach might involve feature extraction and machine learning to identify patterns.

**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided test input, followed by a prediction of the output and a justification based on the patterns observed in the examples.

**Test Input Analysis**

The test input grid displays a scattered cluster of azure (8) pixels. The cluster's shape is irregular and fragmented, unlike the more compact clusters in previous examples.  The azure pixels are not uniformly distributed; there are areas of higher concentration and areas of isolation.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],

   Neighbors of Azure at (6, 1): [np.int64(0), np.int64(8), np.int64(0), np.int64(8), np.int64(0)]



**Predicted Output and Justification**

Based on the observed pattern in the examplesâ€”a partial replacement of edge azure pixels with blue pixelsâ€”I predict the output will show some of the outermost azure pixels changed to blue. The exact number and location of the changes are uncertain due to the seemingly arbitrary nature of the transformation observed in the examples.  The transformation doesn't appear to be entirely deterministic and seems to have a probabilistic element.  

Considering the distribution and adjacency of the azure pixels in the test input, I predict that approximately 2-4 azure pixels will be changed to blue (1).  The selection will likely prioritize those azure pixels with at least one white (0) neighbor.

To illustrate a *possible* output (but not necessarily the only correct one):



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   #Example of a possible output (not necessarily the only correct one)
   #Changes are made arbitrarily to some edge pixels, with at least one white neighbor.
   test_output = np.copy(test_input)
   test_output[0,5] = 1 #Top
   test_output[1,0] = 1 #Left
   test_output[5,1] = 1 #Bottom


   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



The above is one possible output.  Other variations are possible depending on which outer azure pixels are chosen for replacement.  More examples would allow a more precise prediction.  The key takeaway is that a subset of the outermost azure pixels are changed to blue, with a preference toward those adjacent to at least one white pixel.

use function_call to initialize the working output grid:


* initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between
  input and output
* initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
