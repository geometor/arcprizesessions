Okay, I'll review the changes in the working output grid and use code execution to investigate properties.  My current understanding of the transformation rule is that a subset of the outermost azure pixels (those with at least one white neighbor) are changed to blue.  The number of changes isn't fixed, and it appears somewhat arbitrary, but the core pattern holds.

The working output grid is currently identical to the test input.  I need to apply the transformation to generate a potential output.  Since the rule isn't fully deterministic, I'll use code to identify candidate pixels, then choose a subset based on that analysis.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   test_output = np.copy(test_input)

   candidate_pixels = []
   for r in range(test_input.shape[0]):
       for c in range(test_input.shape[1]):
           if test_input[r, c] == 8:
               neighbors = []
               for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
                   for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
                       nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                       if 0 <= nr < test_input.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < test_input.shape[1] and (dr != 0 or dc != 0):
                           neighbors.append(test_input[nr, nc])
               if 0 in neighbors:  # Check for at least one white neighbor
                   candidate_pixels.append((r, c))

   #Arbitrarily select 3 candidate pixels for transformation

   num_to_change = 3
   if len(candidate_pixels) >= num_to_change:
       selected_pixels = candidate_pixels[:num_to_change]
       for r, c in selected_pixels:
           test_output[r, c] = 1
   else:
     print("Not enough candidate pixels to change.")

   print(test_output)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

The code above identifies candidate pixels (outer azure pixels with at least one white neighbor).  It then arbitrarily selects 3 of these to change to blue.  This is one possible output;  others are equally valid given the inherent ambiguity of the transformation rule.

**final output grid:**
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

**Final Answer:** The final output grid is shown above.  The transformation rule is somewhat ambiguous, making a perfectly deterministic prediction difficult.  However, the solution reflects the pattern observed in the examples: a subset of outer azure pixels (those with at least one white neighbor) are replaced by blue pixels.  More examples would be needed to clarify and potentially refine the rule.
