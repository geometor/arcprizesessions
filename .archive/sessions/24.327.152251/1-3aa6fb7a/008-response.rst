Okay, I'll review the changes made to the working output grid and use code execution to investigate its properties.  My current understanding is that the transformation involves changing some outer azure pixels (adjacent to white pixels) to blue. The selection process seems non-deterministic.

The current working output grid has only one azure pixel changed to blue.  Based on my understanding of the rule, more changes are likely needed.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   candidate_pixels = []
   for r in range(working_output.shape[0]):
       for c in range(working_output.shape[1]):
           if working_output[r, c] == 8:
               neighbors = []
               for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
                   for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
                       nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                       if 0 <= nr < working_output.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < working_output.shape[1] and (dr != 0 or dc != 0):
                           neighbors.append(working_output[nr, nc])
               if 0 in neighbors:  # Check for at least one white neighbor
                   candidate_pixels.append((r, c))

   print(f"Candidate pixels for change: {candidate_pixels}")

   # Choose additional pixels to change (arbitrarily)
   additional_changes = 2
   for i in range(min(additional_changes, len(candidate_pixels) )):
       row, col = candidate_pixels[i]
       working_output[row, col] = 1

   print(working_output)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Candidate pixels for change: [(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]
   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

The code above identifies additional candidate pixels and arbitrarily selects two more to change to blue. This is just one possible result; other valid outputs exist given the non-deterministic nature of the transformation.  The final output reflects my interpretation of the transformation rule, but it is important to remember this rule isn't perfectly defined, and variations are likely possible.

**final output grid:**
[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

**Final Answer:** The final output grid is shown above.  The transformation rule is somewhat ambiguous, making a perfectly deterministic prediction difficult.  However, the solution reflects the pattern observed in the examples: a subset of outer azure pixels (those with at least one white neighbor) are replaced by blue pixels.  More examples would be needed to clarify and potentially refine the rule.
