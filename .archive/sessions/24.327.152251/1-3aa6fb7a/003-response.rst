003 â€¢ Response
==============


Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve changing a subset of the outermost azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels are changed isn't strictly defined by a simple geometric rule (like "all outer pixels").  It seems to be a partial, somewhat arbitrary replacement of edge pixels.  The number of changed pixels varies between examples (2 in example 1, 3 in example 2).  The overall shape of the azure cluster is largely preserved.

To further investigate and potentially refine this hypothesis, more examples are needed to discern if there's a hidden pattern determining which edge pixels are selected for transformation.  A more rigorous analysis might involve examining the adjacency relationships of the pixels and looking for consistent local patterns around pixels that are modified.  For instance, is there a preference for changing azure pixels that are adjacent to white (0) pixels?

.. code-block::

   Number of cells changed: 2
   Coordinates of changed pixels: [(1, 2), (4, 4)]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (1,2): [8, 0, 0, 8]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (4,4): [0, 8, 0, 0]
   Number of cells changed: 3
   Coordinates of changed pixels: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 3)]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (1,4): [0, 8, 0, 0]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (2,3): [0, 8, 0, 8]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (5,3): [0, 0, 8, 0]

The code above analyzes the neighbors of the changed pixels.  In both examples, some of the changed pixels are surrounded by at least one white pixel and one or more azure pixels.  However, this analysis isn't conclusive without more examples.  A more sophisticated approach might involve feature extraction and machine learning to identify patterns.
