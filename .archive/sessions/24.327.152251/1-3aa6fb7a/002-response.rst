002 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels in an irregular, roughly L-shaped pattern. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels on the outer edges of the cluster have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at indices: {diff}")
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Analyzing the location of changes
   for i in range(changed_cells):
     row = diff[0][i]
     col = diff[1][i]
     print(f"Cell at row {row}, column {col} changed from {input_grid[row,col]} to {output_grid[row,col]}")

.. code-block::

   Differences found at indices: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))
   Number of cells changed: 3
   Cell at row 1, column 4 changed from 0 to 1
   Cell at row 2, column 3 changed from 0 to 1
   Cell at row 5, column 3 changed from 0 to 1



.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 8
     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 8
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: edge of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the perimeter of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The transformation in example 2 is similar to example 1.  Again, some (but not all) azure pixels at the outer edges of the azure cluster are replaced with blue pixels. The number of changes seems somewhat arbitrary; it's not a consistent number across examples.  A more precise rule determining *which* edge pixels are changed is needed.  More examples would help to clarify.
