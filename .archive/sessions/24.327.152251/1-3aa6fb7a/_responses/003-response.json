            "text": "Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve changing a subset of the outermost azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels are changed isn't strictly defined by a simple geometric rule (like \"all outer pixels\").  It seems to be a partial, somewhat arbitrary replacement of edge pixels.  The number of changed pixels varies between examples (2 in example 1, 3 in example 2).  The overall shape of the azure cluster is largely preserved.\n\n\nTo further investigate and potentially refine this hypothesis, more examples are needed to discern if there's a hidden pattern determining which edge pixels are selected for transformation.  A more rigorous analysis might involve examining the adjacency relationships of the pixels and looking for consistent local patterns around pixels that are modified.  For instance, is there a preference for changing azure pixels that are adjacent to white (0) pixels?\n\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_transformation(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the transformation between input and output grids.\"\"\"\n    diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)\n    changed_cells = len(diff[0])\n    print(f\"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}\")\n\n    changed_pixels = []\n    for i in range(changed_cells):\n        row = diff[0][i]\n        col = diff[1][i]\n        changed_pixels.append((row, col))\n\n    print(\"Coordinates of changed pixels:\", changed_pixels)\n\n    #Analyze adjacency of changed pixels\n    for row, col in changed_pixels:\n        neighbors = []\n        for r in range(max(0, row -1), min(input_grid.shape[0], row + 2)):\n            for c in range(max(0, col -1), min(input_grid.shape[1], col + 2)):\n                if (r,c) != (row,col):\n                    neighbors.append(input_grid[r,c])\n\n        print(f\"Neighbors of changed pixel at ({row},{col}): {neighbors}\")\n\n#Example usage\ninput_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\noutput_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nanalyze_transformation(input_grid_1, output_grid_1)\n\ninput_grid_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])\n\noutput_grid_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])\n\nanalyze_transformation(input_grid_2, output_grid_2)\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nNumber of cells changed: 2\nCoordinates of changed pixels: [(1, 2), (4, 4)]\nNeighbors of changed pixel at (1,2): [8, 0, 0, 8]\nNeighbors of changed pixel at (4,4): [0, 8, 0, 0]\nNumber of cells changed: 3\nCoordinates of changed pixels: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 3)]\nNeighbors of changed pixel at (1,4): [0, 8, 0, 0]\nNeighbors of changed pixel at (2,3): [0, 8, 0, 8]\nNeighbors of changed pixel at (5,3): [0, 0, 8, 0]\n```\n\nThe code above analyzes the neighbors of the changed pixels.  In both examples, some of the changed pixels are surrounded by at least one white pixel and one or more azure pixels.  However, this analysis isn't conclusive without more examples.  A more sophisticated approach might involve feature extraction and machine learning to identify patterns.\n"
