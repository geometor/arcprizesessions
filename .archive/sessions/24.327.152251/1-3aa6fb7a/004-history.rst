**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some azure pixels are replaced by blue (1) pixels.  The replacement seems to occur at the edges or periphery of the azure cluster.

The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the outermost azure pixels with blue pixels.  The number and location of changes aren't strictly defined, it appears to be a  partial edge replacement.  More examples are needed to confirm a more precise rule.

**observations**



The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels in an irregular, roughly L-shaped pattern. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels on the outer edges of the cluster have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at indices: {diff}")
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Analyzing the location of changes
   for i in range(changed_cells):
     row = diff[0][i]
     col = diff[1][i]
     print(f"Cell at row {row}, column {col} changed from {input_grid[row,col]} to {output_grid[row,col]}")

   input:
     width: 7

       - 0: 43
       - 8: 8

       - 0: 40
       - 8: 8

     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: edge of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the perimeter of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The transformation in example 2 is similar to example 1.  Again, some (but not all) azure pixels at the outer edges of the azure cluster are replaced with blue pixels. The number of changes seems somewhat arbitrary; it's not a consistent number across examples.  A more precise rule determining *which* edge pixels are changed is needed.  More examples would help to clarify.



**examples summary**



Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve changing a subset of the outermost azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels are changed isn't strictly defined by a simple geometric rule (like "all outer pixels").  It seems to be a partial, somewhat arbitrary replacement of edge pixels.  The number of changed pixels varies between examples (2 in example 1, 3 in example 2).  The overall shape of the azure cluster is largely preserved.

To further investigate and potentially refine this hypothesis, more examples are needed to discern if there's a hidden pattern determining which edge pixels are selected for transformation.  A more rigorous analysis might involve examining the adjacency relationships of the pixels and looking for consistent local patterns around pixels that are modified.  For instance, is there a preference for changing azure pixels that are adjacent to white (0) pixels?

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Number of cells changed: 2
   Coordinates of changed pixels: [(1, 2), (4, 4)]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (1,2): [8, 0, 0, 8]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (4,4): [0, 8, 0, 0]
   Number of cells changed: 3
   Coordinates of changed pixels: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 3)]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (1,4): [0, 8, 0, 0]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (2,3): [0, 8, 0, 8]
   Neighbors of changed pixel at (5,3): [0, 0, 8, 0]

The code above analyzes the neighbors of the changed pixels.  In both examples, some of the changed pixels are surrounded by at least one white pixel and one or more azure pixels.  However, this analysis isn't conclusive without more examples.  A more sophisticated approach might involve feature extraction and machine learning to identify patterns.
