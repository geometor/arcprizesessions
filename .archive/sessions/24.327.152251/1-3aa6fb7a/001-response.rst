001 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some azure pixels are replaced by blue (1) pixels.  The replacement seems to occur at the edges or periphery of the azure cluster.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at indices: {diff}")
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Analyzing the location of changes
   for i in range(changed_cells):
     row = diff[0][i]
     col = diff[1][i]
     print(f"Cell at row {row}, column {col} changed from {input_grid[row,col]} to {output_grid[row,col]}")

.. code-block::

   Differences found at indices: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))
   Number of cells changed: 2
   Cell at row 1, column 2 changed from 0 to 1
   Cell at row 4, column 4 changed from 0 to 1

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: edge of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the edges of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the outermost azure pixels with blue pixels.  The number and location of changes aren't strictly defined, it appears to be a  partial edge replacement.  More examples are needed to confirm a more precise rule.
