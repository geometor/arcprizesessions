**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels. The replacement seems to occur at the edges of the azure cluster.

     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are replaced by blue pixels.  The specific pattern is not easily determined from this single example.

Based on the single example, the transformation appears to involve replacing some azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels. The location of the changes suggests they are on the edges of the cluster of azure pixels, although more examples are needed to confirm this.  It's possible this is a rule based on proximity to white pixels or a more complex topological rule.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are replaced by blue pixels.

The transformation in this example is consistent with the first example.  Azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are replaced with blue pixels.  There is still no clear pattern in *which* edge pixels are changed, however.  More examples are needed to determine if there is a more specific rule.


    


    

**examples summary**


    


    

Based on the two examples provided, the transformation rule appears to be:  **Replace some azure (8) pixels at the edges of a cluster of azure pixels with blue (1) pixels.**

The rule is not fully specified because it doesn't define *which* edge pixels are replaced.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a sub-rule governing selection of the edge pixels to be changed (e.g.,  top-most, left-most, or a more complex topological rule).

The code identifies edge pixels and changed pixels. Notice that not all edge pixels are changed.  There is no readily apparent pattern in *which* edge pixels are selected for transformation.  More data is needed to discern a more precise rule.  The current hypothesis remains:

**Transformation Rule:** Replace *some* azure (8) pixels at the edges of an azure cluster with blue (1) pixels. The selection of which edge pixels are changed is currently undetermined.
