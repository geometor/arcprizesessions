The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels. The replacement seems to occur at the edges of the azure cluster.

   input:
     width: 7

     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1), color: azure - irregular cluster

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure - irregular cluster
       - size: 2, position: (1,2), (4,5), color: blue - single pixels


   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are replaced by blue pixels.  The specific pattern is not easily determined from this single example.

Based on the single example, the transformation appears to involve replacing some azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels. The location of the changes suggests they are on the edges of the cluster of azure pixels, although more examples are needed to confirm this.  It's possible this is a rule based on proximity to white pixels or a more complex topological rule.
