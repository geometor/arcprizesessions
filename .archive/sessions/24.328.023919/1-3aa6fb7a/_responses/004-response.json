The task is to predict how this grid will be transformed based on the patterns observed in examples 1 and 2.\n\n"

However, there's no clear pattern determining *which* edge pixels are changed.  The rule seems stochastic or dependent on factors not explicitly shown in the input (e.g., a hidden grid influencing which pixels change).\n\n\n**Natural Language Program (refined hypothesis):**\n\nFor each cluster of connected azure pixels (8) in the input grid:  Identify all edge pixels (pixels with at least one adjacent white (0) pixel). Randomly select one or more of these edge pixels and change their color to blue (1). The number of changed pixels per cluster may vary.\n\n**Code Execution (Testing refined hypothesis):**\n\n(The code below simulates the stochastic nature of the transformation.  It's not possible to create a perfectly deterministic prediction due to the ambiguity in the examples.)\n\n"
