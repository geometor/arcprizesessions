The structure/shape is vastly different.\ntransformation:\n  - The output is a smaller grid.\n  - The output seems to focus on a single element from the input (the gray square). The location of the gray square doesn't directly correlate to the location of the red squares in the output.\n  - The number of blue squares in the input might be relevant to the output. The more blue squares, the more red squares in the output (though the placement is not consistent).\n```\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nExample 3 further refines our understanding.  The pattern of red square placement in the 3x3 output grid is not directly related to the position of the single gray square in the input.  However, the number of blue squares in the input *does* correlate to the number of red squares in the output: 6 blue squares result in 2 red squares.\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation involves:\n\n1.  **Identifying the gray square:** Locate the single gray (5) square in the input.\n2.  **Counting blue squares:** Count the number of blue (1) squares in the input.\n3.  **Determining output size:** The output grid will always be 3x3.\n4.  **Placing red squares:** The number of blue squares in the input determines the number of red (2) squares in the output. The placement of the red squares seems to be a pattern related to the corners.\n\n\n**Further Refinement Needed:**\n\nTo more accurately define the transformation, additional examples are necessary to elucidate the exact rules governing the placement of red squares in the 3x3 output based on the number of blue squares in the input.  We also need to determine whether the locations of the red squares have any consistency, in other words if the arrangement is completely random. The current pattern of red square placement in the 3x3 output grid is inconclusive. More examples are needed to check for consistent patterns, possibly utilizing different numbers of blue squares.\n\n\n"
