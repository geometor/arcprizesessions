The key features are:\n    * A single gray (5) square.\n    * Multiple blue (1) squares.\n\n\n2. **Output Grid Initialization:** The output grid is always a 3x3 matrix, filled initially with white (0) squares.\n\n3. **Red Square Placement:** The number of red (2) squares in the output is directly related to the number of blue (1) squares in the input grid.  The exact relationship needs further investigation but a reasonable guess is that the number of red squares is roughly half the number of blue squares.\n\n4. **Red Square Positioning:** The positioning of the red squares in the 3x3 output seems to follow a pattern related to the corners, but  a precise rule cannot be established with only three examples.  More examples with varying numbers of blue squares are needed to confirm this hypothesis and define the pattern precisely.\n\n**Code Execution for Pattern Investigation:**\n\nTo further investigate the pattern, we'll analyze the examples using Python:\n\n"
