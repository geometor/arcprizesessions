The current approach of manually setting pixels is inefficient and likely to lead to errors without a clear understanding of the overall rule set.\n\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a symmetrical pattern around the existing colored cells is too simplistic and fails to capture the complex interactions and boundary conditions observed in the examples.\n\n\nTo move forward, I need additional examples to reveal the underlying rules governing the placement of yellow and orange blocks.  The existing examples do not provide sufficient data to determine these rules reliably. More examples are required to properly determine the rules governing the transformations, and to construct an accurate function.  Without further information, creating a fully accurate solution is not feasible.\n"
