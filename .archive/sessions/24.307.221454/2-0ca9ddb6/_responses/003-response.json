The placement isn't perfectly symmetrical; the proximity and arrangement seem influenced by the positions of the existing colored cells and the grid boundaries. Yellow tends to appear above and below, while orange appears to the sides, but this is not a strict rule.  The number of added blocks also varies depending on the surrounding area. The original colored blocks remain in their original positions.\n\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to be a conditional placement of yellow and orange blocks around non-white cells.  The placement is context-dependent, influenced by the location of the cell relative to the grid boundaries and other colored cells. A more precise rule set would require more examples to handle boundary conditions and the seemingly non-strict symmetry.  The algorithm would likely involve checking for the presence of neighboring cells and adding yellow and orange blocks based on proximity and boundary constraints.\n"
