            "text": "The transformation rule involves adding yellow (4) and orange (7) blocks around existing non-white cells in the input grid.  The placement of these blocks isn't perfectly symmetrical but rather context-dependent, influenced by proximity to the grid boundaries and other colored cells.  Let's break down the observed patterns:\n\n\n**Placement of Yellow (4) Blocks:**\n\n* Yellow blocks tend to appear above and below existing colored cells.  The exact number depends on whether there is space available (i.e., boundary conditions).\n* The distance to the original colored cell is consistently 1 cell above/below.  If there is not enough space, yellow blocks are added to the opposite side.\n\n\n**Placement of Orange (7) Blocks:**\n\n* Orange blocks tend to appear to the left and right of existing colored cells.\n* Similarly, a distance of one cell to the sides is maintained, adjusting for boundary limitations.\n\n\n**Boundary Conditions:**\n\nThe algorithm appears to adapt to the grid boundaries, placing yellow and orange blocks only where space allows.  If a colored cell is near a boundary, the yellow or orange blocks are placed on the opposite side to maintain a roughly symmetric pattern.\n\n\n\n**Algorithm Sketch (Python):**\n\nThis is a rudimentary sketch to illustrate the logic.  A more robust implementation would require careful handling of boundary conditions and possibly more sophisticated pattern matching.\n\n"

The issue likely lies in the incomplete specification of the rule set; there may be more complex interactions between the placement of multiple coloured cells than initially assumed.  Additional examples would be needed to fully discern the rules and improve the algorithm's accuracy.  The current function produces an output closer to example 3, but still does not capture the full complexity of the transformation. To proceed further, I need more examples to identify the missing or more complex rules that explain the inconsistencies in the output.\n"
