Azure predominantly at the 'center' of the object; red pixels occupy the more exterior portions compared to the original gray shape.\n```\n\n**Further Refined Thoughts and Pattern Speculation:**\n\nThe pattern continues to hold across all three examples.  The core transformation is:\n\n1.  **Identify Gray Object:** Locate the connected group of gray (5) pixels.\n\n2.  **Preserve Shape:** Maintain the overall shape and size of this gray object.\n\n3.  **Inverse Color Mapping:** Replace gray pixels with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels such that:\n    *   Red pixels tend to occupy positions that were closer to the exterior of the original gray object's shape.\n    *   Azure pixels tend to occupy positions that were closer to the interior of the original gray object's shape.\n\nThe \"interior\" and \"exterior\" are relative to the shape itself, not necessarily absolute grid positions. The transition seems to follow a rough gradient or boundary that separates the inside from the outside of the gray shape, but more examples are needed for more nuanced rules and exceptions.\n\nThere is no simple mathematical function apparent to directly translate pixel coordinates (x, y) of the gray object to the corresponding output color (2 or 8). The inverse mapping relationship is suggestive of a more sophisticated algorithm possibly involving a boundary detection and an inner/outer region classification.\n\nTo be certain, more examples are needed to define edge cases or exceptions that would allow for a full and robust definition of the algorithm's rules.\n"
