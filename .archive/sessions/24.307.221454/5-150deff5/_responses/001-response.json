The shape is somewhat maintained.\n  transformation:\n    - The central gray object is replaced with a similar-shaped object made up of azure and red pixels. Azure pixels seem to follow the outer shape of the gray object, and the red pixels appear to fill the interior.  There's an interesting 'inversion' or 'reversal' of how the colors are placed within the changed shape.\n\n```\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Pattern Speculation:**\n\nThe transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray object. The new object has a similar overall shape, but its internal structure is different. The new object consists of two colors (azure and red) that seem to inversely fill the space of the original gray object's shape.  There might be a rule determining the precise arrangement of red and azure pixels, but more examples are needed to determine the relationship with certainty.  It's not a simple color replacement; the spatial arrangement matters.\n"
