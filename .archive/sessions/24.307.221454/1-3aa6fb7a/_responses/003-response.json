            "text": "The transformation rule appears to be the replacement of a subset of azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels to change isn't governed by a simple geometric rule (like corners or edges), but seems to involve pixels at the outer edges or periphery of clusters of azure pixels.\n\nThe number of azure pixels changed varies between examples. Example 1 changes 2 pixels, while Example 2 changes 3. This suggests there isn't a fixed number of pixels changed; rather, the number likely depends on the arrangement and size of the azure clusters.\n\nTo clarify the selection criterion, more examples are needed.  A possible approach for a more robust solution would involve feature engineering (e.g., creating features to represent a pixel's position relative to its neighbors) and using a machine learning model to predict which pixels should be changed.  A simpler rule-based system might not adequately capture the nuanced selection process.\n"
