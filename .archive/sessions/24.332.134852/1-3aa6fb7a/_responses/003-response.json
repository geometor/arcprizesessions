The number of light-blue pixels changed seems to be related to the number of edge positions in the cluster (the perimeter).  It's not precisely one-to-one though, as example 1 has 5 light-blue pixels and only 2 were changed.  More data points are needed to determine the exact relationship.\n\n**Code Execution (Verification):**\n\nThe following code will attempt to identify clusters of light-blue pixels and change edge pixels to blue.  It's a preliminary attempt and may need refinement based on additional examples and a clearer understanding of the exact perimeter-to-change ratio.\n\n"

The algorithm correctly identifies clusters and attempts to change edge pixels, but the proportion of edge pixels changed doesn't exactly match the examples. The `num_to_change` calculation needs refinement. More examples are needed to determine the precise rule for selecting which edge pixels to change.  A more sophisticated edge detection or cluster analysis might be needed, or perhaps the rule is not solely based on the perimeter.  The current algorithm works better on example 2.  The discrepancies suggest there might be additional constraints or conditions not fully captured in the current transformation rule.  It's possible the rule is not a simple function of the cluster perimeter.\n"
