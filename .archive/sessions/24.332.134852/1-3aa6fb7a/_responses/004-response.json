The key challenge is determining the precise rule for selecting which edge pixels to change. The previous attempts of simply taking a proportion of edge pixels didn't produce accurate results.  A rule based on the number of neighbors might be more accurate:  An 8-pixel gets changed to a 1-pixel if it only has some number of 8-neighbors (e.g., 2 or 3), effectively focusing on the less densely packed edge pixels.\n\n\n\n**Code Execution (Refined Transformation):**\n\n\n"
