**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of light-blue (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the light-blue pixels near the edges of the cluster have changed to blue (1).

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two light-blue (8) cells changed to blue (1).  These cells are located at the edges of the main light-blue cluster.
   transformation:
     - A subset of light-blue pixels on the edge of the light-blue cluster are changed to blue.

The transformation appears to involve changing a small number of light-blue pixels on the outer edge of the cluster of light-blue pixels to blue pixels.  The exact number and location of the changed pixels might depend on the size and shape of the light-blue cluster.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and define the transformation rule precisely.

**observations**






The input grid in example 2 shows a somewhat L-shaped cluster of light-blue (8) pixels.  The output grid is very similar, but some of the light-blue pixels that are on the edges of the cluster have been changed to blue (1).






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

     width: 7

     colors:
       - 0: 40

     objects:
       - size: 6, position: L-shaped cluster, color: light-blue (8)

   output:

     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: L-shaped cluster, color: light-blue (8)
       - size: 3, position: edges of light-blue cluster, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three light-blue (8) cells changed to blue (1). These cells are located at the edges of the main light-blue cluster.
   transformation:
     - A subset of light-blue pixels on the edge of the light-blue cluster are changed to blue.  The number of changed pixels appears to be related to the perimeter of the light-blue cluster, possibly one pixel for each edge position.

Both examples show a transformation where a subset of light-blue pixels located at the edges of a cluster of light-blue pixels are changed to blue.  The number of pixels changed seems to be related to the perimeter of the light-blue cluster, but more examples would help to better understand the rule.






**examples summary**






Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

**Transformation Rule:**  For each cluster of light-blue (8) pixels, change some of the light-blue pixels located at the outer edge of the cluster to blue (1) pixels. The number of light-blue pixels changed seems to be related to the number of edge positions in the cluster (the perimeter).  It's not precisely one-to-one though, as example 1 has 5 light-blue pixels and only 2 were changed.  More data points are needed to determine the exact relationship.

**Code Execution (Verification):**

The following code will attempt to identify clusters of light-blue pixels and change edge pixels to blue.  It's a preliminary attempt and may need refinement based on additional examples and a clearer understanding of the exact perimeter-to-change ratio.

           # Find edge pixels of the cluster
           min_row, max_row = np.min(cluster_coords[0]), np.max(cluster_coords[0])

   Example 1 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 8 8 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
   Example 2 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]






The code's output for Example 1 and Example 2 does not perfectly match the provided outputs.  The algorithm correctly identifies clusters and attempts to change edge pixels, but the proportion of edge pixels changed doesn't exactly match the examples. The ``num_to_change`` calculation needs refinement. More examples are needed to determine the precise rule for selecting which edge pixels to change.  A more sophisticated edge detection or cluster analysis might be needed, or perhaps the rule is not solely based on the perimeter.  The current algorithm works better on example 2.  The discrepancies suggest there might be additional constraints or conditions not fully captured in the current transformation rule.  It's possible the rule is not a simple function of the cluster perimeter.
