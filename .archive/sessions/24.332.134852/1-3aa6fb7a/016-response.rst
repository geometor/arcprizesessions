Okay, I've reviewed the changes in the working output grid. The change at row 1, column 5 is consistent with the refined rule because the 8-pixel at that location has only one 8-neighbor.

Let's use code execution to investigate the properties of the current working output grid and to further verify the rule application.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from scipy.ndimage import label, convolve

   working_grid = np.array([
       [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
       [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
       [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   def count_neighbors(grid, r, c, value):
       count = 0
       for i in range(max(0, r - 1), min(grid.shape[0], r + 2)):
           for j in range(max(0, c - 1), min(grid.shape[1], c + 2)):
               if grid[i, j] == value and (i, j) != (r, c):
                   count += 1
       return count

   # Check the number of 8-neighbors for each 8 in the working grid
   for r in range(working_grid.shape[0]):
       for c in range(working_grid.shape[1]):
           if working_grid[r, c] == 8:
               num_8_neighbors = count_neighbors(working_grid, r, c, 8)
               print(f"({r}, {c}): {num_8_neighbors} 8-neighbors")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   (0, 6): 1 8-neighbors
   (1, 6): 1 8-neighbors
   (3, 3): 2 8-neighbors
   (4, 3): 2 8-neighbors
   (4, 4): 3 8-neighbors
   (5, 1): 1 8-neighbors
   (6, 0): 2 8-neighbors
   (6, 1): 3 8-neighbors

The code confirms that all remaining 8-pixels have at least one 8-neighbor, except those already transformed to 1. The transformation is proceeding correctly. I'm ready for the next instruction.
