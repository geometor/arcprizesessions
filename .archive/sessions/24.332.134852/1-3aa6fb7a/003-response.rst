Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

**Transformation Rule:**  For each cluster of light-blue (8) pixels, change some of the light-blue pixels located at the outer edge of the cluster to blue (1) pixels. The number of light-blue pixels changed seems to be related to the number of edge positions in the cluster (the perimeter).  It's not precisely one-to-one though, as example 1 has 5 light-blue pixels and only 2 were changed.  More data points are needed to determine the exact relationship.

**Code Execution (Verification):**

The following code will attempt to identify clusters of light-blue pixels and change edge pixels to blue.  It's a preliminary attempt and may need refinement based on additional examples and a clearer understanding of the exact perimeter-to-change ratio.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np
   from scipy.ndimage import label

   def transform_grid(grid):
       # Find connected components (clusters) of light-blue pixels
       light_blue_mask = grid == 8
       labeled_array, num_features = label(light_blue_mask)

       # Iterate over each cluster
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
           cluster_mask = labeled_array == label_num
           cluster_coords = np.where(cluster_mask)

           # Find edge pixels of the cluster
           min_row, max_row = np.min(cluster_coords[0]), np.max(cluster_coords[0])
           min_col, max_col = np.min(cluster_coords[1]), np.max(cluster_coords[1])

           edge_pixels = []
           for r, c in zip(*cluster_coords):
               if r == min_row or r == max_row or c == min_col or c == max_col:
                   edge_pixels.append((r, c))

           #Change a subset of edge pixels to blue
           num_to_change = int(len(edge_pixels) * 0.5) # Adjust this ratio as needed
           for i in range(min(num_to_change,len(edge_pixels))):
             new_grid[edge_pixels[i][0],edge_pixels[i][1]] = 1



       return new_grid

   # Test with example 1
   input_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid_1 = transform_grid(input_grid_1)
   print("Example 1 transformed grid:\n", output_grid_1)


   # Test with example 2
   input_grid_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],

.. code-block::

   Example 1 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 8 8 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
   Example 2 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]






The code's output for Example 1 and Example 2 does not perfectly match the provided outputs.  The algorithm correctly identifies clusters and attempts to change edge pixels, but the proportion of edge pixels changed doesn't exactly match the examples. The ``num_to_change`` calculation needs refinement. More examples are needed to determine the precise rule for selecting which edge pixels to change.  A more sophisticated edge detection or cluster analysis might be needed, or perhaps the rule is not solely based on the perimeter.  The current algorithm works better on example 2.  The discrepancies suggest there might be additional constraints or conditions not fully captured in the current transformation rule.  It's possible the rule is not a simple function of the cluster perimeter.
