The input grid shows a cluster of light-blue (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the light-blue pixels near the edges of the cluster have changed to blue (1).

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-left, color: light-blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-left, color: light-blue (8)
       - size: 2, position: edges of light-blue cluster, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two light-blue (8) cells changed to blue (1).  These cells are located at the edges of the main light-blue cluster.
   transformation:
     - A subset of light-blue pixels on the edge of the light-blue cluster are changed to blue.

The transformation appears to involve changing a small number of light-blue pixels on the outer edge of the cluster of light-blue pixels to blue pixels.  The exact number and location of the changed pixels might depend on the size and shape of the light-blue cluster.  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and define the transformation rule precisely.
