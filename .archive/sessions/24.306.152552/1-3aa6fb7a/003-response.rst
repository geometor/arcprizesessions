Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to add blue (1) pixels adjacent to the existing cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The number of blue pixels added seems to be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster, but the exact placement of these new pixels is not immediately clear from the provided examples.

The transformation doesn't seem entirely deterministic; there's a degree of variability or randomness in the placement of the blue pixels around the azure cluster.  A more robust pattern or rule will likely emerge with the analysis of additional examples.

To further investigate, we could quantify certain aspects of the input and output grids using code execution.  This could involve calculating:

1. **The size of the azure cluster:**  Counting the number of connected azure (8) pixels.
2. **The number of adjacent empty (0) pixels to the azure cluster:** This could help determine the pool of potential locations for new blue pixels.
3. **The distance between newly added blue pixels (1):**  Determining if there's any minimum or maximum distance between the added blue pixels.

This quantitative analysis, combined with more examples, will improve the accuracy of the pattern identification.
