**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.
  - two 1s at the positions (1,2) and (5,4)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '1's appeared in the output where there were previously '0's.
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation appears to involve the addition of two blue (1) pixels.  
- The positions of the added blue pixels are adjacent (but not directly connected) to the existing cluster of azure (8) pixels.  
- There doesn't appear to be a clear rule determining the precise location of the new blue pixels relative to the azure pixels.
- It might be necessary to examine more examples to identify a consistent pattern.

```

To proceed, I need more examples to establish a reliable pattern for predicting the output grid.  The current example shows a small change and doesn't offer a definitive rule.  More examples are crucial for a more comprehensive understanding.

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular L-shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular L-shape.
  - three 1s at positions (1,5), (2,3), (5,3)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '1's appeared in the output where there were previously '0's.
```

**transformation:**
```
- Similar to example 1, this transformation adds blue (1) pixels.
- The added blue pixels are adjacent to the existing azure (8) pixels.
- The placement of the new blue pixels seems somewhat arbitrary, not following a clear geometric rule based on these two examples alone.
- A hypothesis:  The algorithm adds blue pixels to locations adjacent to, but not directly part of, the existing azure (8) cluster. The number of blue pixels added might be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster.

```

**Ruminate Phase**

Based on the two examples, a tentative hypothesis is that the transformation adds blue (1) pixels to locations adjacent to the existing azure (8) cluster. The number of added pixels might be related to the size or the shape of the cluster. However, more examples are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis, and to determine if there are any other rules involved in pixel placement.  The current evidence suggests the algorithm is not strictly deterministic and adds a certain number of blue pixels adjacent to the existing azure cluster in the input.  The positions appear somewhat random or at least based on an unapparent rule, yet always adjacent to the 8s.

To confidently predict outputs, more examples are needed to solidify any proposed rules, especially in determining the exact number and position of the newly added blue pixels.

**examples summary**

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to add blue (1) pixels adjacent to the existing cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The number of blue pixels added seems to be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster, but the exact placement of these new pixels is not immediately clear from the provided examples.

The transformation doesn't seem entirely deterministic; there's a degree of variability or randomness in the placement of the blue pixels around the azure cluster.  A more robust pattern or rule will likely emerge with the analysis of additional examples.

To further investigate, we could quantify certain aspects of the input and output grids using code execution.  This could involve calculating:

1. **The size of the azure cluster:**  Counting the number of connected azure (8) pixels.
2. **The number of adjacent empty (0) pixels to the azure cluster:** This could help determine the pool of potential locations for new blue pixels.
3. **The distance between newly added blue pixels (1):**  Determining if there's any minimum or maximum distance between the added blue pixels.

This quantitative analysis, combined with more examples, will improve the accuracy of the pattern identification.

**test**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
     [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
     [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
     [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
     [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

**observations**

Here's an analysis of the test input, incorporating the findings from the previous examples.

**Test Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 36
  - 8: 11
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming a sprawling, irregular shape.
```

**Transformation Hypothesis Refinement:**

Based on the previous two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to, but not directly part of, the existing azure (8) cluster.  The number of added blue (1) pixels seems to be loosely correlated to the size and complexity of the azure (8) cluster, but no precise formula is apparent yet.  The exact placement of the new blue (1) pixels seems non-deterministic or based on a hidden, more complex rule.


**Tool Code for Quantitative Analysis:**

Let's use Python to analyze the azure cluster in the test input and identify potential locations for new blue pixels.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    input_grid = np.array([
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ])
    
    # Find azure (8) pixels
    azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
    azure_coordinates = list(zip(azure_indices[0], azure_indices[1]))
    
    # Identify adjacent empty (0) cells
    potential_blue_locations = []
    for r, c in azure_coordinates:
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:  # Check adjacent cells
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < input_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < input_grid.shape[1] and input_grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                potential_blue_locations.append((nr, nc))
    
    print(f"Azure coordinates: {azure_coordinates}")
    print(f"Potential blue locations: {potential_blue_locations}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Azure coordinates: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(1))]
Potential blue locations: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(2))]

```

**Proposed Output (Based on Observation and Tool Output):**

Given the size and complexity of the azure cluster, and considering the previous examples, I predict approximately 3 to 5 blue (1) pixels will be added.  The exact locations should be among the `potential_blue_locations` identified by the tool.  I will start by selecting a few from the tool's output, and then evaluate the result before adding more. I will try to maintain some spacing and avoid placing blue pixels directly next to each other.  If the initial choices don't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'll iterate.  Without a definitive rule, an iterative approach seems most appropriate.



**Next Steps:**

1.  Initialize the output grid from the input grid using  `initialize_output_from_input`.
2.  Use `set_pixel` to add blue (1) pixels to a selection of  `potential_blue_locations`, starting with a small number (e.g., three), and then add more only if needed.

**initialize the working output grid:**

<instructions>

use function_call to initialize the working output grid:

- initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output

- initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color

<\instructions>
