Okay, I've initialized the working output grid from the input grid. Now, let's strategically add blue (1) pixels based on the `potential_blue_locations` identified in the tool output.  I'll start by adding three, keeping them somewhat spaced apart and adjacent to the azure (8) cluster.  I'll select (1,5), (3,2), and (5,2) as my initial choices.

**function_call:**
set_pixel(1,5,1)
set_pixel(3,2,1)
set_pixel(5,2,1)

**working output grid**

[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 1 0 8]
 [8 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



<instructions>
- take a moment to review that the changes in the working output grid are in keeping with the rule
- use code_execution to investigate properties
</instructions>

Let's check the updated grid and see if adding more blue pixels is necessary.  We can use code execution to re-analyze the adjacent empty cells after adding the three blue pixels.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    working_grid = np.array([
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
        [8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8],
        [8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ])
    
    # Find azure (8) pixels
    azure_indices = np.where(working_grid == 8)
    azure_coordinates = list(zip(azure_indices[0], azure_indices[1]))
    
    # Identify adjacent empty (0) cells
    potential_blue_locations = []
    for r, c in azure_coordinates:
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:  # Check adjacent cells
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < working_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < working_grid.shape[1] and working_grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                potential_blue_locations.append((nr, nc))
    
    print(f"Azure coordinates: {azure_coordinates}")
    print(f"Potential blue locations: {potential_blue_locations}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Azure coordinates: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(1))]
Potential blue locations: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(2))]

```

The tool output shows there are still several potential locations for adding blue pixels. However, based on the previous examples, adding just three seems consistent with the pattern observed so far. Adding more would likely make the pattern more complex.  Therefore, I propose we submit the current working grid.


**Submit**

The current working output grid is:

[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 1 0 8]
 [8 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

I'm submitting this grid as the solution.  It's consistent with the observed pattern of adding a small number of blue pixels adjacent to the azure cluster in the input grid, maintaining a degree of spacing between added blue pixels.  The number of added blue pixels is in line with the previous examples.  While a more precise rule isn't fully clear from the limited data, this solution aligns well with the observed trends.
