Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 5
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 5
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular shape.
  - two 1s at the positions (1,2) and (5,4)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '1's appeared in the output where there were previously '0's.
```

**transformation:**
```
- The transformation appears to involve the addition of two blue (1) pixels.  
- The positions of the added blue pixels are adjacent (but not directly connected) to the existing cluster of azure (8) pixels.  
- There doesn't appear to be a clear rule determining the precise location of the new blue pixels relative to the azure pixels.
- It might be necessary to examine more examples to identify a consistent pattern.

```

To proceed, I need more examples to establish a reliable pattern for predicting the output grid.  The current example shows a small change and doesn't offer a definitive rule.  More examples are crucial for a more comprehensive understanding.
