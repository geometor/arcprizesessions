**example_2**

**input:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 43
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular L-shape.
```

**output:**
```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - a cluster of 8s forming an irregular L-shape.
  - three 1s at positions (1,5), (2,3), (5,3)
```

**differences:**
```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '1's appeared in the output where there were previously '0's.
```

**transformation:**
```
- Similar to example 1, this transformation adds blue (1) pixels.
- The added blue pixels are adjacent to the existing azure (8) pixels.
- The placement of the new blue pixels seems somewhat arbitrary, not following a clear geometric rule based on these two examples alone.
- A hypothesis:  The algorithm adds blue pixels to locations adjacent to, but not directly part of, the existing azure (8) cluster. The number of blue pixels added might be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster.

```

**Ruminate Phase**

Based on the two examples, a tentative hypothesis is that the transformation adds blue (1) pixels to locations adjacent to the existing azure (8) cluster. The number of added pixels might be related to the size or the shape of the cluster. However, more examples are needed to confirm or refute this hypothesis, and to determine if there are any other rules involved in pixel placement.  The current evidence suggests the algorithm is not strictly deterministic and adds a certain number of blue pixels adjacent to the existing azure cluster in the input.  The positions appear somewhat random or at least based on an unapparent rule, yet always adjacent to the 8s.

To confidently predict outputs, more examples are needed to solidify any proposed rules, especially in determining the exact number and position of the newly added blue pixels.
