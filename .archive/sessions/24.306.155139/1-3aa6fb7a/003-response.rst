The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid based on the presence of azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels isn't consistently defined by a simple geometric rule across both examples.

**Example 1:** Adds a blue pixel directly above and below each azure pixel that has a white (0) pixel both above and below it.

**Example 2:** Adds a blue pixel adjacent to each azure pixel that has a white (0) pixel adjacent to it.  The placement seems prioritized to maintain a 'buffer' of white pixels between clusters.

To clarify the rule and test my hypothesis, let's use code to analyze the examples.  The goal is to identify a pattern or algorithm that predicts the location of the added blue pixels based solely on the location of the azure pixels in the input.

```
added_pixels_ex1=[(np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4))]
added_pixels_ex2=[(np.int64(1), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3))]

```

The code identifies the coordinates of the added blue pixels.  Analyzing these coordinates in relation to the original azure pixels reveals a more nuanced pattern than initially hypothesized.  A simple adjacency rule doesn't fully capture the transformation.  The placement seems context-dependent, possibly influenced by the surrounding pixels and the overall shape of the azure cluster. A more sophisticated algorithm is needed to fully model this, perhaps involving analyzing local pixel neighborhoods. More examples are necessary to generalize a robust transformation rule.
