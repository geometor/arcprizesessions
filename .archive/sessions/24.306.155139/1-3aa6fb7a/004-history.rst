**observations**

**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
- objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
- objects:
    - The 'azure' cluster remains.
    - Two 'blue' pixels appear, one above and one below the original 'azure' cluster.  They are located in the same column as a cluster element and are one row away.

**Differences:**

- cells_changed: 2
- colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to add a 'blue' pixel above and below the 'azure' cluster.  The 'blue' pixels are vertically aligned with 'azure' pixels and are placed in the adjacent row above and below. The placement seems to be independent of the 'azure' pixel count.

**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (8)
- objects:
    - A cluster of 8 'azure' pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.

**Output:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (35)
    - 8: (8)
    - 1: (3)
- objects:
    - The 'azure' cluster remains.
    - Three 'blue' pixels appear, one adjacent to the original 'azure' cluster on its left and another on its bottom and one in the middle.

**Differences:**

- cells_changed: 3
- colors_changed: Three pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, this example also adds 'blue' pixels around the existing 'azure' cluster. However, unlike Example 1, the placement pattern appears to be more related to the adjacency of existing 'azure' pixels. 'Blue' pixels appear adjacent to 'azure' pixels.  The number of 'blue' pixels added seems to be related to the number of 'azure' pixels with a value of 1 on at least one side.


**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples demonstrate a transformation that adds 'blue' pixels to the input grid based on the location of 'azure' pixels (value 8). The exact placement of the new 'blue' pixels differs slightly between the examples, suggesting a potential rule based on adjacency or proximity to existing 'azure' pixels. Example 1 seems to suggest a vertical placement, adding one above and below, while Example 2 seems more concerned with adding adjacent pixels.  A more robust rule might be needed to incorporate both example behaviors.  Further examples are needed to determine the precise rules of the transformation.

**examples summary**

The transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid based on the presence of azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels isn't consistently defined by a simple geometric rule across both examples.

**Example 1:** Adds a blue pixel directly above and below each azure pixel that has a white (0) pixel both above and below it.

**Example 2:** Adds a blue pixel adjacent to each azure pixel that has a white (0) pixel adjacent to it.  The placement seems prioritized to maintain a 'buffer' of white pixels between clusters.

To clarify the rule and test my hypothesis, let's use code to analyze the examples.  The goal is to identify a pattern or algorithm that predicts the location of the added blue pixels based solely on the location of the azure pixels in the input.

```
added_pixels_ex1=[(np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4))]
added_pixels_ex2=[(np.int64(1), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3))]

```

The code identifies the coordinates of the added blue pixels.  Analyzing these coordinates in relation to the original azure pixels reveals a more nuanced pattern than initially hypothesized.  A simple adjacency rule doesn't fully capture the transformation.  The placement seems context-dependent, possibly influenced by the surrounding pixels and the overall shape of the azure cluster. A more sophisticated algorithm is needed to fully model this, perhaps involving analyzing local pixel neighborhoods. More examples are necessary to generalize a robust transformation rule.
