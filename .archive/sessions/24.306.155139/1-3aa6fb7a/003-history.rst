**observations**

**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
- objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
- objects:
    - The 'azure' cluster remains.
    - Two 'blue' pixels appear, one above and one below the original 'azure' cluster.  They are located in the same column as a cluster element and are one row away.

**Differences:**

- cells_changed: 2
- colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to add a 'blue' pixel above and below the 'azure' cluster.  The 'blue' pixels are vertically aligned with 'azure' pixels and are placed in the adjacent row above and below. The placement seems to be independent of the 'azure' pixel count.

**Example 2 Analysis**

**Input:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (8)
- objects:
    - A cluster of 8 'azure' pixels forming an irregular 'L' shape.

**Output:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (35)
    - 8: (8)
    - 1: (3)
- objects:
    - The 'azure' cluster remains.
    - Three 'blue' pixels appear, one adjacent to the original 'azure' cluster on its left and another on its bottom and one in the middle.

**Differences:**

- cells_changed: 3
- colors_changed: Three pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, this example also adds 'blue' pixels around the existing 'azure' cluster. However, unlike Example 1, the placement pattern appears to be more related to the adjacency of existing 'azure' pixels. 'Blue' pixels appear adjacent to 'azure' pixels.  The number of 'blue' pixels added seems to be related to the number of 'azure' pixels with a value of 1 on at least one side.


**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples demonstrate a transformation that adds 'blue' pixels to the input grid based on the location of 'azure' pixels (value 8). The exact placement of the new 'blue' pixels differs slightly between the examples, suggesting a potential rule based on adjacency or proximity to existing 'azure' pixels. Example 1 seems to suggest a vertical placement, adding one above and below, while Example 2 seems more concerned with adding adjacent pixels.  A more robust rule might be needed to incorporate both example behaviors.  Further examples are needed to determine the precise rules of the transformation.
