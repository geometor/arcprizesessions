**Example 1 Analysis**

**Input:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (40)
    - 8: (6)
- objects:
    - A cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

- width: 7
- height: 7
- colors:
    - 0: (38)
    - 8: (6)
    - 1: (2)
- objects:
    - The 'azure' cluster remains.
    - Two 'blue' pixels appear, one above and one below the original 'azure' cluster.  They are located in the same column as a cluster element and are one row away.

**Differences:**

- cells_changed: 2
- colors_changed: Two pixels changed from 0 (white) to 1 (blue).

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to add a 'blue' pixel above and below the 'azure' cluster.  The 'blue' pixels are vertically aligned with 'azure' pixels and are placed in the adjacent row above and below. The placement seems to be independent of the 'azure' pixel count.
