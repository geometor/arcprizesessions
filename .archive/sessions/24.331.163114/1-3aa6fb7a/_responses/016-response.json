The inter-cluster distances now vary, indicating a more complex relationship than initially suspected.  Simple adjacency is insufficient to explain this transformation. The minimum distances between clusters are calculated using `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist`.  The fact that the distances are greater than 0 in some cases further complicates the rule.\n\nTo make further progress, I need additional examples to identify a more comprehensive and robust rule that can account for these observations. The current evidence suggests that proximity is a major factor, but other characteristics of the clusters (e.g., size, shape) might also play a role.\n"
