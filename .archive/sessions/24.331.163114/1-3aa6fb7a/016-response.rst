The changes made to the working output grid continue to follow the pattern observed in the examples: Azure pixels directly adjacent to other azure pixels are transformed to blue. However, the limited number of examples and the lack of a clear definition of "adjacency" prevent me from confirming if this is the complete rule. There might be more complex adjacency definitions or additional conditions that are not yet apparent.

Let's investigate the properties of the updated working grid using code_execution:






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np
   from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist

   def analyze_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       clusters = []
       visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                   cluster = []
                   q = [(r, c)]
                   visited[r, c] = True
                   while q:
                       curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)
                       cluster.append((curr_r, curr_c))
                       for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                           nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc
                           if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \
                              grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:
                               q.append((nr, nc))
                               visited[nr, nc] = True
                   clusters.append(cluster)
       return clusters

   def calculate_intercluster_distances(clusters):
       if not clusters:
           return []
       num_clusters = len(clusters)
       distances = []
       for i in range(num_clusters):
           for j in range(i + 1, num_clusters):
               cluster1_coords = np.array(clusters[i])
               cluster2_coords = np.array(clusters[j])
               min_dist = np.min(cdist(cluster1_coords, cluster2_coords))
               distances.append(min_dist)
       return distances

   working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],
                         [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   clusters = analyze_grid(working_grid)
   print(f"Clusters in working grid: {clusters}")
   intercluster_distances = calculate_intercluster_distances(clusters)
   print(f"Inter-cluster distances in working grid: {intercluster_distances}")






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Clusters in working grid: [[(0, 5)], [(1, 6)], [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)], [(5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0)]]
   Inter-cluster distances in working grid: [np.float64(1.4142135623730951), np.float64(3.605551275463989), np.float64(6.4031242374328485), np.float64(3.605551275463989), np.float64(6.4031242374328485), np.float64(2.23606797749979)]






The cluster analysis reveals that the transformation has broken down the larger cluster of azure pixels into smaller, more isolated clusters.  The inter-cluster distances now vary, indicating a more complex relationship than initially suspected.  Simple adjacency is insufficient to explain this transformation. The minimum distances between clusters are calculated using ``scipy.spatial.distance.cdist``.  The fact that the distances are greater than 0 in some cases further complicates the rule.

To make further progress, I need additional examples to identify a more comprehensive and robust rule that can account for these observations. The current evidence suggests that proximity is a major factor, but other characteristics of the clusters (e.g., size, shape) might also play a role.
