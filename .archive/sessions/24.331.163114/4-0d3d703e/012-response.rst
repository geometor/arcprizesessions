The ``set_range`` function call correctly filled the first column of the working output grid with the color 9 (maroon), consistent with the hypothetical color mapping of 8 (azure) to 9 (maroon) from the test input grid.  This mapping was arbitrarily chosen due to the lack of a clearly defined mapping rule based solely on the provided examples.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[9, 0, 0],
                              [9, 0, 0],
                              [9, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3],
                         [8, 1, 3],
                         [8, 1, 3]])

   test_mapping = {8: 9, 1: 5, 3: 4}

   test_output = np.array([[test_mapping[x] for x in row] for row in test_input])

   print("\nTest Output (using the same hypothetical mapping):\n", test_output)

   #Check if the first column of working_output matches the first column of test_output
   column_match = np.array_equal(working_output[:, 0], test_output[:, 0])
   print(f"\nFirst column match between working output and test output: {column_match}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Working Output Grid:
    [[9 0 0]
    [9 0 0]
    [9 0 0]]

   Test Output (using the same hypothetical mapping):
    [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]

   First column match between working output and test output: True

The code confirms that the first column of the ``working_output`` grid matches the first column of the ``test_output`` grid, further supporting the consistency of the (hypothetical) color mapping applied so far.  However, the uncertainty due to the lack of a deterministic mapping rule remains.  More examples are crucial to overcome this limitation.  The current state is only a partial, tentative solution based on a non-guaranteed assumption.
