            "text": "The change to the working output grid is consistent with the hypothesized color mapping from the test input grid analysis.  The top-left pixel (row 0, column 0) in the input grid is color 8 (azure). In my previous hypothetical mapping, I mapped 8 to 9 (maroon).  Therefore, setting the top-left pixel of the working output grid to color 9 is in line with that mapping.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that this mapping was a *hypothetical* one, chosen arbitrarily due to the lack of a discernible pattern in the examples.  There is no guarantee that this is the correct mapping.  More examples are absolutely necessary to establish a definitive rule.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output = np.array([[9, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Output Grid:\\n\", working_output)\n\ntest_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3],\n                      [8, 1, 3],\n                      [8, 1, 3]])\n\n#Let's apply the hypothetical mapping used previously\n\ntest_mapping = {8: 9, 1: 5, 3: 4}\n\ntest_output = np.array([[test_mapping[x] for x in row] for row in test_input])\n\nprint(\"\\nTest Output (using the same hypothetical mapping):\\n\", test_output)\n\n```\n\ncode_execution_result:\n```\nWorking Output Grid:\n [[9 0 0]\n [0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]]\n\nTest Output (using the same hypothetical mapping):\n [[9 5 4]\n [9 5 4]\n [9 5 4]]\n```\n\nThe code confirms that the update to the working output grid is consistent with the hypothetical mapping.  However, the lack of a deterministic rule to derive the correct mapping remains a major limitation.  The output grid is only partially complete, and its correctness is contingent on the validity of the hypothetical mapping, which lacks solid justification.  Further examples are critically needed to solve the puzzle reliably.\n"
