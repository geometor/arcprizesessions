This is a correct starting point for applying the transformation, as we are expecting a 3x3 output grid based on the examples.  The color mapping is yet to be determined, which is the next step.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Output Grid:\\n\", working_output)\n\n#The working output grid is currently empty (all 0s).  Further analysis and code is needed to fill the grid based on the input grid and a determined (or hypothesized) color mapping.\n```\n\ncode_execution_result:\n```\nWorking Output Grid:\n [[0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]]\n```\n\nThe code confirms the working output grid is correctly initialized.  The next step is to analyze the input grid and apply a color mapping based on the observed patterns in the examples.  Due to the lack of a deterministic mapping rule, I'll use a hypothetical mapping as a working assumption.  However, this will not necessarily produce a correct result, and more examples would be needed to establish a more certain mapping strategy.\n"
