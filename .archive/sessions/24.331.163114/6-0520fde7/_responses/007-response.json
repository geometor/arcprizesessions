The `analyze_blue_symmetry` function highlights a flaw in my initial hypothesis; although the blue pixels are distributed somewhat symmetrically, they don't perfectly follow a strict mirror symmetry across the central axis.  Despite this, the output suggests that a less strict notion of symmetry is sufficient to predict the outcome.\n\nThe function is useful in assessing a potential pattern, but it doesn't currently fully encapsulate the rule for red pixel placement.   A more refined approach might involve considering the proximity of blue pixels to the center of the 3x3 output grid, allowing for slight variations in their distribution while still predicting red pixel placement accurately.  Further examples are needed to fully refine the rule.\n\n\n**Revised Hypothesis (incorporating the test case):**\n\n1.  **Size Reduction:** The 3x7 input grid is reduced to a 3x3 grid, centered around the gray column.\n\n2.  **Center Pixel:** The central pixel of the 3x3 grid retains its original color (if non-zero), otherwise it's white.\n\n3.  **Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels are placed in the corners of the 3x3 grid if there is a roughly symmetrical distribution of blue pixels in the input around the gray column.  The degree of symmetry needed to trigger this outcome isn't yet precisely defined.  A more detailed analysis considering the number and positions of blue pixels relative to the center of the 3x3 grid could help clarify this rule.  More examples would still be beneficial.\n\n\nThe fact that the prediction was correct despite the imperfect symmetry in the test input's blue pixel distribution reinforces the idea that a more nuanced understanding of \"symmetry\" within this context is needed, rather than a purely geometrical interpretation.  The next examples may shed more light on this.\n"
