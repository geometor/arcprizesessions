            "text": "The changes made to the working output grid are partially in keeping with the rule, but some adjustments are needed. The goal is to replace gray pixels (5) with light blue (8) and red (2) pixels, with light blue predominating in the center and red at the edges.\n\nThe current working grid still contains many gray (5) pixels.  The single red (2) pixel added in the previous step is in a reasonable location, but more are needed, particularly around the perimeter of the gray shape.\n\n\nLet's proceed with further transformations, aiming for a better distribution of light blue and red while maintaining the overall shape.\n\nLet's continue with the transform_grid function but this time we only apply the transformation to a subset of the pixels and leave the rest for visual inspection.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef transform_grid(grid, num_to_transform):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    gray_indices = np.where(grid == 5)\n    gray_pixels = list(zip(gray_indices[0], gray_indices[1]))\n\n    #calculate the center of mass of the gray pixels\n    center_row = np.mean(gray_indices[0])\n    center_col = np.mean(gray_indices[1])\n\n    num_transformed = 0\n    for row, col in gray_pixels:\n        if num_transformed >= num_to_transform:\n            break\n\n        distance_to_center = np.sqrt((row - center_row)**2 + (col - center_col)**2)\n        #probability of blue increases as it gets closer to the center\n        probability_blue = 1 - distance_to_center / np.max(np.sqrt((gray_indices[0] - center_row)**2 + (gray_indices[1] - center_col)**2))\n        probability_blue = max(0,min(1, probability_blue)) # keep probability between 0 and 1\n\n        if random.random() < probability_blue:\n            transformed_grid[row, col] = 8\n        else:\n            transformed_grid[row, col] = 2\n        num_transformed += 1\n\n    return transformed_grid\n\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid, 10) #only transform 10 pixels\nprint(transformed_grid)\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\n[[0 0 8 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 0]\n [0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0]\n [0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n```"
