            "text": "The working output grid is currently identical to the input grid.  The transformation rules learned from the examples indicate that the gray pixels (5) should be replaced by light blue (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining the overall shape. The light blue should be predominantly in the center, and the red around the edges.\n\nLet's perform a transformation using a modified approach to more accurately reflect the observed pattern.  This approach will still have a degree of randomness, as the exact placement of red and blue pixels shows some inconsistency in the examples.  The goal is to find a balance between deterministic rules and the observed variations.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef transform_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    gray_indices = np.where(grid == 5)\n    gray_pixels = list(zip(gray_indices[0], gray_indices[1]))\n\n    #calculate the center of mass of the gray pixels\n    center_row = np.mean(gray_indices[0])\n    center_col = np.mean(gray_indices[1])\n\n    for row, col in gray_pixels:\n        distance_to_center = np.sqrt((row - center_row)**2 + (col - center_col)**2)\n        #probability of blue increases as it gets closer to the center\n        probability_blue = 1 - distance_to_center / np.max(np.sqrt((gray_indices[0] - center_row)**2 + (gray_indices[1] - center_col)**2))\n        probability_blue = max(0,min(1, probability_blue)) # keep probability between 0 and 1\n\n        if random.random() < probability_blue:\n            transformed_grid[row, col] = 8\n        else:\n            transformed_grid[row, col] = 2\n    return transformed_grid\n\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(transformed_grid)\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\n[[0 0 8 8 0 2 8 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n```\n\nThis improved version considers the distance of each gray pixel from the center of mass of all gray pixels. The closer a pixel is to the center, the higher its probability of being transformed to light blue (8).  This creates a more gradual transition from light blue in the center to red on the edges.\n\n\n**working output grid**\nupdated with your changes\n\n[[0 0 8 8 0 2 8 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\n\n"
