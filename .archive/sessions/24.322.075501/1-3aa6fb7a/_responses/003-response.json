Then, a subset of those azure pixels\u2014specifically those located at or near the perimeter of the cluster\u2014are changed to blue (1) pixels.  The number of azure pixels changed to blue appears to be related to the size and shape of the cluster, but there's no precise, predictable formula for determining exactly which pixels are modified.
