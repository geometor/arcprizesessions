   Differences at rows: [0 0 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6], columns: [5 6 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 1]
   Values changed from [8 8 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 8 8] to [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]

   Pixel at (3,2) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (4,0) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (5,1) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (6,0) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (6,1) adjacent to white: True

   Number of remaining azure pixels: 6
   Azure pixel at (1, 0) is adjacent to white: True
   Azure pixel at (1, 6) is adjacent to white: True
   Azure pixel at (3, 3) is adjacent to white: True
   Azure pixel at (4, 3) is adjacent to white: True
   Azure pixel at (5, 1) is adjacent to white: True
   Azure pixel at (6, 0) is adjacent to white: True

The code confirms that all changes made are consistent with the rule.  All azure pixels adjacent to a white pixel have been converted to blue. There are six remaining azure pixels; all of them are adjacent to white pixels.

Let's apply the transformation to these remaining pixels.

**update working grid**
function_call:
set_pixel

result:
True
set_pixel(row=1, column=0, color=1)
**working output grid**

updated with your changes
