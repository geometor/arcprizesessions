The working output grid is currently identical to the input grid.  The transformation hasn't been applied yet. To apply the transformation, I need to execute the ``transform_grid`` function.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       """Transforms a grid according to the observed rule."""
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8:  # Azure
                   if (r > 0 and grid[r - 1, c] == 0) or \
                      (r < rows - 1 and grid[r + 1, c] == 0) or \
                      (c > 0 and grid[r, c - 1] == 0) or \
                      (c < cols - 1 and grid[r, c + 1] == 0):
                       new_grid[r, c] = 1  # Change to blue
       return new_grid

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   test_output = transform_grid(test_input)
   print("Test Output:\n", test_output)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Test Output:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

The ``transform_grid`` function has been applied.  The resulting ``test_output`` shows the transformation of azure pixels adjacent to white pixels to blue pixels.  This is consistent with my interpretation of the (potentially flawed) examples.  I am ready for the next step.
