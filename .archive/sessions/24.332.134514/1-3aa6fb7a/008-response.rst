The change made to the working output grid (changing one azure pixel to blue) is consistent with the transformation rule *as I currently understand it*.  However, as previously noted, the provided examples contain inconsistencies, so my understanding might be incomplete or incorrect. The rule, as I have implemented it, states that an azure pixel is changed to blue only if it is directly adjacent (orthogonally) to a white pixel.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                            [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                            [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                            [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   #Check if the only change is consistent with the rule.
   original_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                            [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                            [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                            [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                            [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(working_grid != original_grid)
   print(f"Difference at row {diff[0][0]}, column {diff[1][0]}: changed from {original_grid[diff]} to {working_grid[diff]}")

   # Verify adjacency to white
   r, c = diff[0][0], diff[1][0]
   adjacent_to_white = False
   if r > 0 and original_grid[r - 1, c] == 0:
       adjacent_to_white = True
   if r < working_grid.shape[0] - 1 and original_grid[r + 1, c] == 0:
       adjacent_to_white = True
   if c > 0 and original_grid[r, c - 1] == 0:
       adjacent_to_white = True
   if c < working_grid.shape[1] - 1 and original_grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
       adjacent_to_white = True

   print(f"Pixel at ({r},{c}) adjacent to white: {adjacent_to_white}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Difference at row 1, column 1: changed from [8] to [1]
   Pixel at (1,1) adjacent to white: True

The code confirms that the single change made is consistent with the rule (azure pixel adjacent to white pixel changed to blue).  However, without reliable example data, I cannot be certain that this rule is completely accurate.  I am awaiting further instructions or clarified examples.
