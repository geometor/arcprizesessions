**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels bordering white pixels have changed to blue (1).  It appears that only the azure pixels directly adjacent to white pixels are transformed.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences at rows: {diff[0]}, columns: {diff[1]}")
   print(f"Values changed from {input_grid[diff]} to {output_grid[diff]}")

   #Check for adjacency to white
   for r, c in zip(diff[0], diff[1]):
       adjacent_to_white = False
       if r > 0 and input_grid[r-1, c] == 0:
           adjacent_to_white = True
       if r < input_grid.shape[0] -1 and input_grid[r+1,c] == 0:
           adjacent_to_white = True
       if c > 0 and input_grid[r, c-1] == 0:
           adjacent_to_white = True
       if c < input_grid.shape[1] -1 and input_grid[r, c+1] == 0:
           adjacent_to_white = True

       print(f"Pixel at ({r},{c}) adjacent to white: {adjacent_to_white}")






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Differences at rows: [1 4], columns: [2 4]
   Values changed from [0 0] to [1 1]
   Pixel at (1,2) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (4,4) adjacent to white: True






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 3, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: center-left, color: blue


   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - If an azure pixel is adjacent to a white pixel, change it to blue.

The natural language program for the transformation is:  For each pixel in the input grid, if the pixel's value is 8 (azure) and it is adjacent to a pixel with value 0 (white), change the pixel's value to 1 (blue).  Otherwise, keep the pixel's value unchanged.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
