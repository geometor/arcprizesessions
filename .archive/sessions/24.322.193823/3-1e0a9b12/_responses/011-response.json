            "text": "The `set_range` function call and its effect on the `working_output` grid are still unclear.  The provided parameters and the resulting grid don't follow a consistent pattern, and the output doesn't align with the established transformation rules.\n\nTo proceed effectively, I need a clear definition of the `set_range` function.  What are its arguments? What does it do? How does it contribute to the overall transformation process of moving elements from the input grid to the output grid while preserving their horizontal order and position within the bottom rows?  Without this crucial information, I cannot verify the correctness of the `set_range` calls and cannot complete the puzzle.  Additional examples of its usage would also be highly beneficial.\n\n\nTo summarize, I need the following information:\n\n1. **Definition of `set_range`:** A precise description of the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  A code implementation would be ideal.\n2. **Relationship to Transformation:** An explanation of how `set_range` is used within the transformation process. How do its inputs and outputs relate to the input and output grids?\n3. **Additional Examples:** If possible, further examples of `set_range` usage to illustrate its behavior in various contexts.\n\nWith this information, I can continue to build a robust solution that correctly transforms the input grid into the output grid.\n"
