            "text": "The transformation from input to output grids involves three main steps:\n\n1. **Downsampling:** The input grid (always 3x7) is downsampled to a 3x3 grid. This is done by simply taking a subset of the input grid.  The selection of which cells to keep isn't explicitly defined yet but seems to be related to the central column and the edges.  Further analysis is needed to determine the exact selection.\n\n2. **Color Replacement:** After downsampling, most cells in the 3x3 grid are replaced with white (0).\n\n3. **Conditional Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels (2) are placed conditionally.  The exact condition is not fully clear yet. Examples show this is related to the presence and distribution of blue pixels (1) in the input grid.  In example 1, a single vertical structure of blue pixels resulted in a single central red pixel. In example 2, two vertical structures resulted in three red pixels forming a vertical pattern.  In example 3, a more dispersed clustering of blue pixels led to two red pixels in the corners.\n\nThe challenge is to formalize this \"conditional placement\" rule. A simple column count threshold won't work for all examples.  A more sophisticated approach might involve analyzing the spatial distribution of blue pixels and using some kind of clustering algorithm or a rule based on connected components analysis to determine whether to place red pixels and their positions.\n\n\n"

The simple `blue_count` rule does not correctly predict the output for any example.  To improve it, we need a more sophisticated approach to determining the presence and spatial distribution of the blue pixels.  Ideas for improvement include:\n\n* **Connected Component Analysis:**  Identify connected regions of blue pixels. The number of connected components or their sizes could influence the number and placement of red pixels.\n* **Center of Mass:** Calculate the center of mass for the blue pixels. This might provide a better way to determine the position of the red pixel.\n* **More sophisticated downsampling:** instead of simply using the top-left 3x3 region, the downsampling should consider the distribution of blue pixels and strategically pick locations for the 3x3 output grid.  It seems the central column and the edges are significant.\n\n\nThe natural language program should describe these more complex steps.  A completely accurate natural language program cannot be written without a precise definition for these image processing steps.  The provided code demonstrates that the current understanding is insufficient to solve the puzzle.\n"
