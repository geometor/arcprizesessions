The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a roughly L-shape.  The output grid is identical except that some of the azure pixels on the right side and bottom of the cluster are changed to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, those azure pixels that are adjacent to at most one other azure pixel are transformed into blue pixels.

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 2
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure
       - size: 2, position: (1,2) and (4,4), color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels with less than two adjacent azure pixels become blue.

The transformation appears to be a simple rule based on adjacency. Azure pixels that only have one or zero adjacent azure pixels are changed to blue.  The code above verifies this.
