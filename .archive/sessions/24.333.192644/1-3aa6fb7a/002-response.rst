The input grid in example 2 is similar to example 1, containing a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid shows the same cluster, but some azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  The pattern seems consistent with the first example: azure pixels with fewer than two adjacent azure pixels are transformed into blue pixels.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   def count_adjacent(grid, r, c):
       count = 0
       for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:

               if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                   continue
               nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
               if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and grid[nr, nc] == 8:
                   count += 1
       return count


   for r, c in zip(*diff):
     print(f"At index ({r}, {c}) adjacent count is {count_adjacent(input_grid,r,c)}")

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 3
       - 1:3
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels with fewer than two adjacent azure pixels become blue.

The code shows that the changes are occurring at positions where the number of adjacent azure pixels is at least 2.  This confirms my hypothesis. The natural language program for the transformation is: "Change any azure pixel to blue if it has fewer than two adjacent azure pixels".
