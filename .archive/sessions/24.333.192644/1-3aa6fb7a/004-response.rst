   Azure pixel at (0, 5) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (0, 6) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (1, 0) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (1, 1) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (1, 6) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (2, 0) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (3, 3) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (4, 3) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (4, 4) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (5, 1) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (6, 0) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (6, 1) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.






Based on the analysis of the previous examples and the application of the derived transformation rule to the test input, the predicted output is as follows:

Since all azure pixels in the test input have at least two adjacent azure pixels, none will be changed to blue.  Therefore, the output grid will be identical to the input grid.

   Predicted output:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]






**Final Answer:** The output grid is identical to the input grid because no azure pixels meet the criteria for transformation (having fewer than two adjacent azure pixels).
