The working output grid is identical to the input grid, which is consistent with the rule.  All azure pixels have at least two adjacent azure pixels; therefore, no transformations should occur. The code confirms this.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
