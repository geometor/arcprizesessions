002 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid contains a collection of azure (8) pixels arranged in an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern. The output grid is very similar, but some of the azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  These blue pixels seem to be located at positions that are adjacent to other azure pixels, but not on the very outer edge of the cluster.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
   print("Difference grid:\n", diff_grid)

   azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
   print("\nIndices of azure pixels in input grid:", azure_indices)

   changed_indices = np.where(diff_grid != 0)
   print("\nIndices of changed pixels:", changed_indices)

.. code-block::

   Difference grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Indices of azure pixels in input grid: (array([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6]), array([4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4]))

   Indices of changed pixels: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))



The code confirms that several azure pixels have been changed to blue.  The changed pixels are located within the cluster but not on the very outer edge.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 9
     objects:
       - size: 9, position: (0,4) to (6,4) L-shaped cluster, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (0,4) to (6,4) L-shaped cluster, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: (1,4), (2,3), (5,3), color: blue - individual pixels

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue

   transformation:
     - Some internal azure pixels are changed to blue.
