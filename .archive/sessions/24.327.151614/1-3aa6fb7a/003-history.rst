**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  The blue pixels appear to be located at specific positions relative to the azure cluster.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
   print("Difference grid:\n", diff_grid)

   azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
   print("\nIndices of azure pixels in input grid:", azure_indices)

   changed_indices = np.where(diff_grid != 0)
   print("\nIndices of changed pixels:", changed_indices)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Difference grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Indices of azure pixels in input grid: (array([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]), array([1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5]))

   Indices of changed pixels: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))



Based on the code execution, the transformation involves changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1). The changed pixels appear to be those that are at the edge of the cluster and are either below or to the right of other azure pixels (though more examples would be needed to confirm this pattern).

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1) to (4,5), color: azure - irregular cluster

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1) to (4,5), color: azure - irregular cluster
       - size: 2, position: (1,2), (4,4), color: blue - individual pixels

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are changed to blue.  The pattern seems related to position within the cluster.

**observations**



The input grid contains a collection of azure (8) pixels arranged in an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern. The output grid is very similar, but some of the azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  These blue pixels seem to be located at positions that are adjacent to other azure pixels, but not on the very outer edge of the cluster.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
   print("Difference grid:\n", diff_grid)

   azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
   print("\nIndices of azure pixels in input grid:", azure_indices)

   changed_indices = np.where(diff_grid != 0)
   print("\nIndices of changed pixels:", changed_indices)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Difference grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Indices of azure pixels in input grid: (array([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6]), array([4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4]))

   Indices of changed pixels: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))



The code confirms that several azure pixels have been changed to blue.  The changed pixels are located within the cluster but not on the very outer edge.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 9
     objects:
       - size: 9, position: (0,4) to (6,4) L-shaped cluster, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (0,4) to (6,4) L-shaped cluster, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: (1,4), (2,3), (5,3), color: blue - individual pixels

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue

   transformation:
     - Some internal azure pixels are changed to blue.
