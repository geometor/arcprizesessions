            "text": "The changes made to the working output grid are consistent with the transformation rule derived from the examples.  The code correctly identifies clusters of azure pixels and then modifies a subset of the edge pixels (those adjacent to non-azure pixels) within those clusters to blue. The randomness in the selection of which edge pixels to change means that the exact output could vary slightly on different runs, but the general pattern should remain the same.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n                      [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\n\ndef find_clusters(grid):\n    clusters = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:\n                cluster = []\n                stack = [(r, c)]\n                while stack:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = stack.pop()\n                    if 0 <= curr_r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= curr_c < grid.shape[1] and \\\n                       grid[curr_r, curr_c] == 8 and not visited[curr_r, curr_c]:\n                        cluster.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                        visited[curr_r, curr_c] = True\n                        for dr, dc in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]: #check only adjacent pixels\n                            nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                            if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]:\n                                stack.append((nr,nc))\n                clusters.append(cluster)\n    return clusters\n\nclusters = find_clusters(working_grid)\nprint(f'{clusters=}')\n\n#Analyze the number of blue and azure pixels\nblue_count = np.count_nonzero(working_grid==1)\nazure_count = np.count_nonzero(working_grid==8)\ntotal_pixels = working_grid.size\nprint(f'{blue_count=}')\nprint(f'{azure_count=}')\nprint(f'{total_pixels=}')\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nclusters=[[(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)], [(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]]\nblue_count=3\nazure_count=12\ntotal_pixels=49\n```\nThe code confirms the number of blue and azure pixels in the working grid.
