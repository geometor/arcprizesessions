**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of light blue (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the light blue pixels adjacent to a white pixel have changed to blue (1).  Specifically, the light blue pixels on the edges of the cluster seem to be the ones affected.

     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-left, color: light blue (8)
       - size: 2, position: edges of light blue cluster, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 cells changed from light blue (8) to blue (1).  These cells were on the edge of the light blue cluster and adjacent to white (0) cells.

   transformation:
     - If a light blue (8) cell is adjacent to a white (0) cell, change the light blue cell to blue (1).

The transformation appears to be a simple rule:  Light blue (8) cells that are adjacent to white (0) cells are changed to blue (1).  The code confirms that only two cells changed, both light blue to blue, and both at the edge of the initial light blue cluster.

**observations**






The input grid shows a scattered cluster of light blue (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some of the light blue pixels have been changed to blue (1).  Again, it appears that the light blue pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel are the ones that change to blue.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = input_grid - output_grid
   print("Difference between input and output:\n", diff)

   # Count number of changed cells
   changed_cells = np.count_nonzero(diff)
   print(f"\nNumber of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   input:

     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 11
     objects:
       - size: 11, position: scattered, color: light blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 8
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: light blue (8)
       - size: 3, position: edges of light blue clusters, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 cells changed from light blue (8) to blue (1). These cells were on the edge of a light blue cluster and adjacent to white (0) cells.

   transformation:
     - If a light blue (8) cell is adjacent to a white (0) cell, change the light blue cell to blue (1).

The transformation rule remains consistent with the first example.  The code confirms that three light blue cells changed to blue, all located on the edges of light blue clusters and next to white cells.






**examples summary**






The transformation rule is consistent across both examples:  Light blue (8) cells that are adjacent to white (0) cells are changed to blue (1). This rule applies to each light blue cell individually, regardless of the overall pattern or cluster size.

The code confirms this by identifying the changed cells and their locations, showing that only light blue cells adjacent to white cells are affected.  The number of cells changed varies depending on the input grid's arrangement of light blue cells and their proximity to white cells.

To summarize: The transformation is a local, edge-detection rule applying only to light blue pixels which are adjacent to a white pixel.

Let's test this hypothesis with a function:






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for i in range(rows):
           for j in range(cols):
               if grid[i, j] == 8:
                   #check for adjacent white cells
                   adjacent_white = False
                   for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
                       if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and grid[x, y] == 0:
                           adjacent_white = True
                           break
                   if adjacent_white:
                       new_grid[i, j] = 1
       return new_grid

   # Test with example 1

                             [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   print("Example 1 transformed grid:\n", example1_output)


   # Test with example 2
   example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                             [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   example2_output = transform_grid(example2_input)
   print("\nExample 2 transformed grid:\n", example2_output)






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Example 1 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Example 2 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 1 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]]






The code's output for example 1 and example 2  does not match the provided outputs. The function correctly identifies and transforms light blue cells adjacent to white cells, however it seems there is more to the transformation than just this single rule. There might be other conditions or rules that needs to be considered.  Further examples are needed to refine the transformation rule.
