The input grid shows a scattered cluster of light blue (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some of the light blue pixels have been changed to blue (1).  Again, it appears that the light blue pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel are the ones that change to blue.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = input_grid - output_grid
   print("Difference between input and output:\n", diff)

   # Count number of changed cells
   changed_cells = np.count_nonzero(diff)
   print(f"\nNumber of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Identify changed cells locations
   changed_indices = np.where(diff != 0)
   print(f"\nIndices of changed cells: {changed_indices}")

.. code-block::

   Difference between input and output:
    [[ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0 -1  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0 -1  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0 -1  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]]

   Number of cells changed: 3

   Indices of changed cells: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 11
     objects:
       - size: 11, position: scattered, color: light blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 8
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: light blue (8)
       - size: 3, position: edges of light blue clusters, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 cells changed from light blue (8) to blue (1). These cells were on the edge of a light blue cluster and adjacent to white (0) cells.

   transformation:
     - If a light blue (8) cell is adjacent to a white (0) cell, change the light blue cell to blue (1).

The transformation rule remains consistent with the first example.  The code confirms that three light blue cells changed to blue, all located on the edges of light blue clusters and next to white cells.
