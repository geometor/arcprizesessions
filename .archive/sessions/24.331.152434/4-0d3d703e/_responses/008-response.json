            "text": "The current situation is that we have four examples of a 3x3 grid transformation where each color is mapped to a different color, uniquely for each example.  There is no discernible pattern or overarching rule relating these mappings.  The test input is another 3x3 grid, and without knowing the specific mapping for this test case, we cannot reliably predict the output.  The provided `initialize_output_by_size` function creates a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white), which is a reasonable starting point in the absence of a specific mapping rule.\n\nTo proceed, we need either:\n\n1.  **More examples:**  Additional examples, ideally including examples that show transformations with at least some of the colors present in the test input (8, 1, 3).  This might reveal a hidden pattern or rule.\n2.  **The mapping rule:** The specific mapping of colors for the test input.  This would allow a direct, deterministic transformation.\n\nWithout more information, any attempt to fill the working output grid is pure speculation and likely to be incorrect.  The current working grid, filled with zeros, is the best we can do given the lack of information.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Grid:\\n\", working_grid)\n\n#Further analysis is impossible without knowing the mapping\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Grid:\n [[0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]]\n```"
