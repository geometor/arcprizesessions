This is purely speculative, as there's no guarantee the same mapping applies to this test case.\n\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[8, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0],\n                         [0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Grid:\\n\", working_grid)\n\n#Analysis is limited without knowing the mapping rule.\n#The next step would require more information or a hypothesis about the mapping.\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Grid:\n [[8 0 0]\n [0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]]\n```\n\nWithout additional information (more examples or the specific mapping for this test case), further updates to the working grid are pure conjecture and likely to be incorrect.  The current state of the working grid reflects a single, arbitrary assignment.  A reliable solution requires additional information.\n"
