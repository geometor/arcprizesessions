            "text": "The current working output grid `[[8 9 3], [0 9 3], [0 9 3]]` is based on the assumption that the transformation involves a column-wise color mapping, where each input column maps to a specific output column with a unique color. However, this is a conjecture; there's no guarantee this is correct, as the previous examples showed no such consistent rule. Each example had a completely unique color mapping.\n\nThe current assignments are:\n\n- Input color 8 (azure) maps to output color 8.\n- Input color 1 (blue) maps to output color 9 (maroon).\n- Input color 3 (green) maps to output color 3 (green).\n\nThere is no consistency in these mappings with the previous examples.\n\nLet's investigate further using code:\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[8, 1, 3],\n                     [8, 1, 3],\n                     [8, 1, 3]])\n\noutput_grid = np.array([[8, 9, 3],\n                       [0, 9, 3],\n                       [0, 9, 3]])\n\nprint(\"Input Grid:\\n\", input_grid)\nprint(\"\\nOutput Grid (Working):\\n\", output_grid)\n\nmapping = {}\nfor i in range(3):\n    if output_grid[0, i] != 0:  # Skip unmapped columns\n      mapping[input_grid[0, i]] = output_grid[0, i]\n\n\nprint(\"\\nPartial Mapping (from top row):\", mapping)\n\nconsistent = True\nfor row in range(3):\n    for col in range(3):\n        if input_grid[row, col] in mapping and mapping[input_grid[row, col]] != output_grid[row, col]:\n            consistent = False\n            break\n    if not consistent:\n        break\n\nprint(f\"\\nConsistent Mapping (Partially checked): {consistent}\")\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nInput Grid:\n [[8 1 3]\n [8 1 3]\n [8 1 3]]\n\nOutput Grid (Working):\n [[8 9 3]\n [0 9 3]\n [0 9 3]]\n\nPartial Mapping (from top row): {8: 8, 1: 9, 3: 3}\n\nConsistent Mapping (Partially checked): False\n```\n\nThe code shows that even the partial mapping from the top row is inconsistent because the bottom two rows do not match the suggested mapping from the top row.  The \"column-wise mapping\" hypothesis is refuted.  The solution is likely to be completely different.  Without further examples or a direct indication of the mapping rule, any further attempts to complete the working output grid would be mere speculation.  More information is crucial.\n"
