Based on the previous examples, the transformation is a deterministic color mapping where the spatial arrangement of colors remains unchanged.  Each color in the input grid is replaced by a new color in the output grid. However, the mapping is unique to each example; there's no overarching rule to predict the mapping for a new input.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[8, 1, 3],
                        [8, 1, 3],
                        [8, 1, 3]])

   # Let's try to predict based on previous mappings, though we know this is unreliable. 
   # We'll need to make assumptions or look for partial patterns within the mappings.

   #Example Mappings from previous examples
   example_mappings = [
       {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6},
       {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9},
       {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2},
       {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}
   ]

   possible_outputs = []
   for mapping in example_mappings:
       output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
       for i in range(3):
           for j in range(3):
               if input_grid[i,j] in mapping:
                   output_grid[i,j] = mapping[input_grid[i,j]]
               else:
                   output_grid[i,j] = -1 # indicate that it is not mapped
       possible_outputs.append(output_grid)

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nPossible Output Grids based on previous example mappings:")
   for i, output_grid in enumerate(possible_outputs):
       print(f"\nPossible Output {i+1}:\n", output_grid)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]

   Possible Output Grids based on previous example mappings:

   Possible Output 1:
    [[-1  5  4]
    [-1  5  4]
    [-1  5  4]]

   Possible Output 2:
    [[9  5  4]
    [9  5  4]
    [9  5  4]]

   Possible Output 3:
    [[9  5 -1]
    [9  5 -1]
    [9  5 -1]]

   Possible Output 4:
    [[-1  5 -1]
    [-1  5 -1]
    [-1  5 -1]]

The code shows that based on the previous examples' mappings, there's no consistent way to predict the output for this input. Each previous mapping yields a different (and mostly incomplete) prediction. This reinforces the observation that a new mapping rule is needed for this specific case.  Without additional information or examples with similar color combinations, a reliable prediction is impossible.  There is no clear pattern to suggest a transformation rule beyond "each color is mapped to another color in a way that is determined uniquely for each puzzle"

To solve this puzzle, we would need either:


#. **Additional examples:** More input-output pairs showing similar or related transformations. These additional examples could reveal hidden patterns or rules that govern the mapping.
#. **The mapping rule:** Explicitly stated mapping for this puzzle.  This would allow for direct translation of the input grid to the output grid.

Without either of these, any answer would be pure speculation.  We need more information to deduce the transformation rule.
