The update to the working output grid, setting the top-left pixel to color 8 (azure), is a tentative step based on the assumption that the transformation might involve a consistent color mapping, although we've seen no evidence of a consistent mapping across all previous examples.  This is purely speculative, as there's no guarantee the same mapping applies to this test case.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[8, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)

   #Analysis is limited without knowing the mapping rule.
   #The next step would require more information or a hypothesis about the mapping.

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[8 0 0]
    [0 0 0]
    [0 0 0]]

Without additional information (more examples or the specific mapping for this test case), further updates to the working grid are pure conjecture and likely to be incorrect.  The current state of the working grid reflects a single, arbitrary assignment.  A reliable solution requires additional information.
