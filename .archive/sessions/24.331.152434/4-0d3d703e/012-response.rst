The ``set_range`` function has modified the working output grid by setting the central column to color 9 (maroon).  This action is still highly speculative, as there's no evidence from previous examples to support a consistent column-wise mapping or any other consistent pattern relating input and output.  Each example demonstrated a unique, independent color mapping.  While this column-wise change *might* reflect a hidden pattern, it's equally likely to be coincidental or completely wrong without more information.

The action is therefore still a hypothesis, not a deduction from consistent rules.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([[8, 9, 0],
                            [0, 9, 0],
                            [0, 9, 0]])

   print("Working Grid:\n", working_grid)

   # No consistent pattern can be definitively established without more information.
   # The current working grid is a hypothesis, not a derived solution.

.. code-block::

   Working Grid:
    [[8 9 0]
    [0 9 0]
    [0 9 0]]

The code simply displays the current working grid.  Without additional examples or the explicit mapping for this specific puzzle, further analysis is impossible.  The current state of the working grid is a result of arbitrary choices and assumptions, and there's no guarantee it reflects the correct solution.  More information is needed to proceed reliably.
