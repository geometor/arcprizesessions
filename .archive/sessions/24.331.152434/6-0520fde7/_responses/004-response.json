The central 3x3 section of the input is relevant to the output.\n\n2. **Color Replacement:**\n    * Blue (1) pixels are removed.\n    * Gray (5) pixels are replaced by white (0) pixels.\n\n3. **Red Pixel Addition:** Red (2) pixels are added to the 3x3 output grid. The pattern of red pixel placement varies across examples:\n    * **Example 1:** One central red pixel.\n    * **Example 2:** A symmetrical cross pattern of red pixels.\n    * **Example 3:** Red pixels at corners (1,0) and (2,2).\n\nThe positioning of the red pixels seems to depend on the distribution of blue pixels in the input grid's central 3x3 region.  A more sophisticated analysis is needed to determine the precise rules governing red pixel placement.  However, we can formulate a preliminary natural language program that takes into account these three steps:\n\n**Natural Language Program (Preliminary):**\n\n1. Reduce the input grid to its central 3x3 section.\n2. Replace all gray pixels in the reduced grid with white pixels.\n3. Remove all blue pixels.\n4. Add red pixels based on the pattern observed in the examples (requires further analysis to define a precise rule).\n\n**Code Execution (Further Analysis):**\n\nThe following code analyzes the relationship between the blue pixels in the input's central 3x3 section and the red pixel placement in the output.\n\n"
