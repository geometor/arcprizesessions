            "text": "The working output grid now has a single red (2) pixel at the center (row 1, column 1).  This is consistent with the predicted output from the `analyze_transformation` function and Example 1, where there is a central red pixel when there are 2 blue pixels in the central 3x3 region of the input grid.  However, it's crucial to reiterate that the `analyze_transformation` function is still incomplete, and this prediction should be considered provisional.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 2, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Output Grid:\\n\", working_output)\nprint(\"\\nWorking Output Grid Shape:\", working_output.shape)\nprint(\"\\nUnique values in Working Output Grid:\", np.unique(working_output))\nprint(\"\\nWorking Output Color Counts:\", np.bincount(working_output.flatten()))\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Output Grid:\n [[0 0 0]\n [0 2 0]\n [0 0 0]]\n\nWorking Output Grid Shape: (3, 3)\n\nUnique values in Working Output Grid: [0 2]\n\nWorking Output Color Counts: [8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n```\n\nThe code confirms the update: a single red pixel (2) is now present in the center of the 3x3 grid, and there are 8 white pixels and 1 red pixel.  The next step would be to further refine the `analyze_transformation` function to handle other patterns of blue pixels in the central 3x3 region of the input grid more accurately.  More examples would be very beneficial for this purpose.\n"
