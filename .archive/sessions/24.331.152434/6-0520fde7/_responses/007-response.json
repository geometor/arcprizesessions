This aligns with the observation that the output grids in all previous examples are 3x3 and the initial step of the transformation involves reducing the input grid to its central 3x3 section.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0],\n                          [0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Output Grid:\\n\", working_output)\nprint(\"\\nWorking Output Grid Shape:\", working_output.shape)\nprint(\"\\nUnique values in Working Output Grid:\", np.unique(working_output))\nprint(\"\\nWorking Output Color Counts:\", np.bincount(working_output.flatten()))\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Output Grid:\n [[0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]\n [0 0 0]]\n\nWorking Output Grid Shape: (3, 3)\n\nUnique values in Working Output Grid: [0]\n\nWorking Output Color Counts: [9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n```\n\nThe code confirms the working output grid is a 3x3 grid filled with zeros (white).  This is consistent with the transformation rules observed in the examples, where the initial step is to create an empty 3x3 output grid.  The next step would be to add the red pixels based on the pattern inferred from the examples (which, as previously discussed, needs further refinement).\n"
