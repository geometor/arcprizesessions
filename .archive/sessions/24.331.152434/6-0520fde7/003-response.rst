The input grid is a 3x7 grid, containing white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) pixels. The blue pixels are somewhat clustered, with a central column of gray pixels.  The output grid is a 3x3 grid, containing white (0) and red (2) pixels. The red pixels are located at (1,0) and (2,2).

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                         [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                          [2, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 2]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   print("\nInput Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)

   print("\nUnique values in Input Grid:", np.unique(input_grid))
   print("Unique values in Output Grid:", np.unique(output_grid))

   input_counts = np.bincount(input_grid.flatten())
   output_counts = np.bincount(output_grid.flatten())

   print("\nInput Color Counts:", input_counts)
   print("Output Color Counts:", output_counts)

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 9
       - 1: 8
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: (1,1), position: (2,0), color: blue
       - size: (2,2), position: (1,0), color: blue
       - size: (3,1), position: (3,0), color: gray
       - size: (2,2), position: (4,1), color: blue


   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 7
       - 2: 2
     objects:
       - size: (1,1), position: (1,0), color: red
       - size: (1,1), position: (2,2), color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 18
     colors_changed: blue and gray pixels are replaced by white and red pixels.
   transformation:
     - The input grid is reduced in size.
     - Blue pixels are mostly removed.  Some are replaced by red pixels.
     - Gray pixels are replaced by white pixels.
     - Red pixels are added to the output grid.

The transformation continues to show a size reduction (to a 3x3 grid), removal of blue pixels (some replaced by red), gray pixels replaced by white, and the addition of red pixels.  The placement of red pixels is less symmetrical than in example 2.  A definitive pattern is still elusive, but there's consistency in the removal/replacement of colors and size reduction.
