The input grid is a 5x5 grid. It contains several colored cells (blue, green, red, magenta) scattered within a field of white cells. The output grid appears to be a result of moving the colored cells to the bottom rows while maintaining their relative positions. The colored cells are consolidated at the bottom, forming a somewhat rectangular shape.  The transformation is again similar to the previous examples, with colored cells being grouped at the bottom.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 3, 0, 1, 2],
                         [6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 3, 0, 1, 0],
                          [6, 3, 0, 1, 2]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   input_colors = {}
   output_colors = {}

   for color in np.unique(input_grid):
       input_colors[color] = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == color)

   for color in np.unique(output_grid):
       output_colors[color] = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == color)

   print("\nInput Colors:", input_colors)
   print("\nOutput Colors:", output_colors)

   cells_changed = np.sum(input_grid != output_grid)
   print("\nCells Changed:", cells_changed)

code_execution_result:

   Output Colors: {0: 16, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 3, 6: 1}

   Cells Changed: 8

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 5
     height: 5
     colors:
       - 0: 16
       - 1: 2
       - 2: 1
       - 3: 3
       - 6: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,3), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: green
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,3), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,4), color: red
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: magenta
       - size: 1x1, position: (4,1), color: green

   output:
     width: 5
     height: 5
     colors:
       - 0: 16
       - 1: 2
       - 2: 1
       - 3: 3
       - 6: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: green
       - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: magenta
       - size: 1x1, position: (4,1), color: green
       - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: red
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue


   differences:
     cells_changed: 8
     colors_changed: No colors changed, only positions
   transformation:
     - The colored cells are moved to the bottom two rows, maintaining their relative order and positions as much as possible.

The transformation is consistent with the previous examples: non-white cells are moved to the bottom rows, preserving their relative positions as much as possible, forming a block in the bottom right.  The size of the block adjusts to fit all the colored cells.
