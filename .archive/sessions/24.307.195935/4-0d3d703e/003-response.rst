   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - color: gray, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: azure, size: 3x1, position: center-left
         - color: magenta, size: 3x1, position: top-right
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - color: blue, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: maroon, size: 3x1, position: center-left
         - color: red, size: 3x1, position: top-right
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All colors are replaced with different colors. The mapping is not consistent with previous examples.  5->1, 8->9, 6->2.
     transformation:
       - The transformation is not a simple arithmetic operation or a consistent mapping.  A more complex rule is likely at play.  It's difficult to infer a pattern based on only three examples.  More examples are needed.

After reviewing the three examples, it's clear that there isn't a simple, consistent mathematical rule governing the transformation from input to output grids.  The transformations observed are:


* **Example 1:**  Adds 3 to each color value (1->4, 2->5, 3->6).
* **Example 2:** A more complex mapping (2->6, 3->4, 8->9).  No obvious arithmetic relationship.
* **Example 3:** Another complex mapping (5->1, 8->9, 6->2).  Again, no obvious arithmetic relationship.

The lack of a consistent arithmetic pattern suggests the transformation might be based on a different principle, perhaps a look-up table or a more abstract rule involving the relative positions or arrangements of the colors. The limited number of examples makes it difficult to definitively determine the transformation rule.  More examples are needed to identify a pattern.
