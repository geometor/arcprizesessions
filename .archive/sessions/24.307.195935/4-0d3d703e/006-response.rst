Based on the analysis of the previous examples, I hypothesize that the transformation isn't based on a simple arithmetic operation or a consistent mathematical function applied to individual color values. Instead, the transformation likely involves a more complex rule or perhaps a lookup table that maps specific color combinations to their corresponding outputs.  The limited number of examples makes it hard to definitively determine the rule, but by carefully examining the input-output pairs, we can try to identify patterns.

Let's represent the input-output mappings from the examples as a dictionary:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   example_mappings = {
       (1, 2, 3): (4, 5, 6),
       (2, 3, 8): (6, 4, 9),
       (5, 8, 6): (1, 9, 2),
       (9, 4, 2): (8, 3, 6)
   }



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::





The test input is ``[[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]``.  Notice that none of the example mappings directly match this input combination.

However, we can try to find some patterns:


#. **Sequential Mapping:** There's no consistent sequential addition or subtraction across all examples.  Example 1 is an exception, adding 3.


#. **Relative Position:**  The position of colors within the grid doesn't seem to directly affect the transformation.  The outputs maintain the same spatial arrangement of the colors.


#. **Lookup Table (Hypothesis):** Given the inconsistencies, a lookup table seems most plausible. We would need a significantly larger dataset to confidently construct a complete lookup table.

Given the limited examples, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves a form of lookup table that we cannot fully determine due to the number of examples. We'll try some educated guesses and see where it leads.

**Prediction for Test Input:**

Since there's no clear rule discernible from the examples, predicting the output for the test input requires some speculation.  We could either:

a) **Assume a pattern:** If we *incorrectly* assume the pattern is a simple addition/subtraction to each color value, it would fail on other examples.

b) **Guess based on similar examples:** We can analyze the examples and try to extrapolate what kind of result we might expect.  The lack of a consistent pattern makes this a less reliable method.

c) **Default prediction:** In the absence of a clear pattern, we could try a default prediction.  Since many examples result in a different arrangement of colors and values, we could speculate on what that might be.

**Due to the lack of a clear rule, the following is a tentative prediction based on the limited data available and the lack of a clearer rule:**

Since the provided data is limited, an accurate prediction cannot be made. The best course of action is to require additional examples before a reliable prediction is possible.  However, to demonstrate an attempt, let's assume the transformation is more complex and involves a sort of randomized mapping (this is not proven by the data!) which is determined only implicitly through the examples.

**Tentative Prediction (Unreliable):**

I cannot reliably predict the output. The transformations observed across the provided examples are not consistent enough to confidently extrapolate a rule or mapping for the test input.  Additional data is needed to determine the transformation process accurately.
