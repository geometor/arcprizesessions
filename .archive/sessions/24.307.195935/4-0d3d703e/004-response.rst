   example_4:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 9: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - color: maroon, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: yellow, size: 3x1, position: center-left
         - color: red, size: 3x1, position: top-right
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 8: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - color: azure, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: green, size: 3x1, position: center-left
         - color: magenta, size: 3x1, position: top-right
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All colors are replaced with different colors.  The mapping is not consistent with previous examples. 9->8, 4->3, 2->6
     transformation:
       - There's no obvious mathematical or geometric pattern.  The transformation seems arbitrary or based on a lookup table.  The color mapping is not consistent across examples.

After analyzing all four examples, the conclusion remains that there's no simple, consistent mathematical or geometric rule to describe the transformation from input to output grids.  The mappings between input and output colors are inconsistent across the examples. This suggests that the solution might involve a complex rule or a lookup table that maps specific color combinations to their corresponding outputs.  The lack of a clear pattern makes it difficult to predict the output for a new input grid without further information or more examples.  A rule based on position or a look up table might be better suited for this transformation.
