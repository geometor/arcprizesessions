   example_2:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 2: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 8: 3
       objects:
         - color: red, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: green, size: 3x1, position: center-left
         - color: azure, size: 3x1, position: top-right
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 6: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 9: 3
       objects:
         - color: magenta, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: yellow, size: 3x1, position: center-left
         - color: maroon, size: 3x1, position: top-right
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All colors are replaced with different colors.  The mapping is not a simple addition, but appears to be a more complex transformation.  2->6, 3->4, 8->9.
     transformation:
       - The transformation is not a simple addition like in example_1.  It seems to involve a more complex mapping of input colors to output colors.  The mapping is not immediately obvious.

The second example shows a different transformation than the first. While the first example uses a simple addition of 3 to each color value, the second example shows a more complex mapping.  There's no immediately apparent mathematical formula or pattern relating input to output colors.  It will require further examples to discern the underlying rule.
