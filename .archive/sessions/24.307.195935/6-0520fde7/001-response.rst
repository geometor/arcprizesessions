Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 16
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: a block of blue and white pixels with a central column of gray pixels
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue, white, and gray; output has white and red.  Size drastically reduced
     transformation:
       - The output is a much smaller grid.
       - The only non-white pixel in the output is red, located in the center.
       - There is no obvious direct relationship between the colors or arrangement of pixels in the input and output.  More examples are needed to establish a transformation rule.

The transformation from input to output is not immediately obvious.  The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.  The output contains only one non-white pixel, which is red and located in the center.  More examples are needed to determine the rule governing this transformation.
