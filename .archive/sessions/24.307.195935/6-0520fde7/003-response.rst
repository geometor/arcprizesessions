   example_3:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: a block of blue and white pixels with a central column of gray pixels. Similar distribution of blue and white to example 2
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 7
         - 2: 2
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,0, color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: 2,2, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue, white, and gray; output has white and red. Size drastically reduced
     transformation:
       - The output is a much smaller grid (3x3).
       - The number of blue pixels in the input seems to influence the pattern in the output.  The number of red pixels appears to be correlated to the number of blue pixels in the input.
       - The output contains two red pixels, one in the center-left and another in the bottom-right.
       - There's no obvious direct mapping of individual pixels.
       - The central column of gray pixels in the input might be significant.

**Revised Ruminate Phase:**

The three examples strongly suggest a transformation that involves:


#. 
   **Downsizing:** The input is always reduced to a 3x3 output grid.

#. 
   **Red Pixel Placement:**  The number of red pixels in the output seems to be related to the number of blue pixels in the input.  More blue pixels lead to more red pixels.

#. 
   **Positional Relationship (Hypothesis):** The location of the red pixels in the output might not be completely random but could be determined by some pattern or relationship to the central column of gray pixels and the distribution of blue pixels in the input.  It appears to favor positions close to the centre of the output.  Further examples would help confirm this hypothesis.

#. 
   **Irrelevance of White Pixels:** The white pixels in the input do not seem to influence the output significantly.

**Next Steps:**

To confirm these hypotheses and potentially uncover the precise transformation rules, more examples are needed, particularly those that vary the number of blue pixels and their distribution within the input grid while keeping the gray column relatively consistent.  This would help isolate the influence of blue pixel count on the number of red pixels and potential positional rules.  Examples with different arrangements of blue pixels (but the same count) would help clarify the influence on position.  The exact mapping from blue pixels to red pixel positions and their arrangement is still unclear.
