The exact position of the red pixels within the 3x3 grid is still a hypothesis based on limited data.

The placement of the red pixels seems to favor central and near-central positions, exhibiting some symmetry.  Further examples would be needed to definitively confirm the placement rules for the red pixels, but the current rule set provides a strong predictive capability.\n"
