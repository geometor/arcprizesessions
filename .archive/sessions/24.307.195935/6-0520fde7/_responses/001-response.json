More examples are needed to establish a transformation rule.\n\n```\n\nThe transformation from input to output is not immediately obvious.  The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.  The output contains only one non-white pixel, which is red and located in the center.  More examples are needed to determine the rule governing this transformation.\n"
