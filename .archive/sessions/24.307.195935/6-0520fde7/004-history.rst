Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 16
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: a block of blue and white pixels with a central column of gray pixels
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue, white, and gray; output has white and red.  Size drastically reduced
     transformation:
       - The output is a much smaller grid.
       - The only non-white pixel in the output is red, located in the center.
       - There is no obvious direct relationship between the colors or arrangement of pixels in the input and output.  More examples are needed to establish a transformation rule.

The transformation from input to output is not immediately obvious.  The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.  The output contains only one non-white pixel, which is red and located in the center.  More examples are needed to determine the rule governing this transformation.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: a block of blue and white pixels with a central column of gray pixels. More blue than in example_1
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 6
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 0,1, color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,2, color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: 2,1, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue, white, and gray; output has white and red. Size drastically reduced
     transformation:
       - The output is a much smaller grid (3x3).
       - The number of blue pixels in the input seems to influence the pattern in the output.
       - The output contains three red pixels arranged in a plus (+) shape, symmetrically centered.
       - There's no obvious direct mapping of individual pixels.
       - The central column of gray pixels in the input might be significant.

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, several hypotheses emerge:


#. 
   **Size Reduction:** The output grid is consistently much smaller than the input.  A potential rule could involve taking the central region or a specific proportion of the input.

#. 
   **Color Transformation:** Gray pixels in the input might play a role in determining the location and quantity of red pixels in the output. The number of blue pixels might also play a role, as example 2 has more blue pixels than example 1, and correspondingly more red pixels in the output.

#. 
   **Symmetry:** The arrangement of red pixels in the output shows some symmetry (a central pixel and mirrored pixels above and below, or horizontally).

#. 
   **Central Region Focus:** The transformation appears to prioritize the central region or a core section of the input grid.

To test these hypotheses, I need more examples to solidify the transformation rule.  The relationship between the number of blue and gray pixels and the arrangement of red pixels in the output needs further clarification.  The exact size reduction method also needs to be determined (e.g., is it always a 3x3 output?).

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: a block of blue and white pixels with a central column of gray pixels. Similar distribution of blue and white to example 2
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 7
         - 2: 2
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,0, color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: 2,2, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue, white, and gray; output has white and red. Size drastically reduced
     transformation:
       - The output is a much smaller grid (3x3).
       - The number of blue pixels in the input seems to influence the pattern in the output.  The number of red pixels appears to be correlated to the number of blue pixels in the input.
       - The output contains two red pixels, one in the center-left and another in the bottom-right.
       - There's no obvious direct mapping of individual pixels.
       - The central column of gray pixels in the input might be significant.

**Revised Ruminate Phase:**

The three examples strongly suggest a transformation that involves:


#. 
   **Downsizing:** The input is always reduced to a 3x3 output grid.

#. 
   **Red Pixel Placement:**  The number of red pixels in the output seems to be related to the number of blue pixels in the input.  More blue pixels lead to more red pixels.

#. 
   **Positional Relationship (Hypothesis):** The location of the red pixels in the output might not be completely random but could be determined by some pattern or relationship to the central column of gray pixels and the distribution of blue pixels in the input.  It appears to favor positions close to the centre of the output.  Further examples would help confirm this hypothesis.

#. 
   **Irrelevance of White Pixels:** The white pixels in the input do not seem to influence the output significantly.

**Next Steps:**

To confirm these hypotheses and potentially uncover the precise transformation rules, more examples are needed, particularly those that vary the number of blue pixels and their distribution within the input grid while keeping the gray column relatively consistent.  This would help isolate the influence of blue pixel count on the number of red pixels and potential positional rules.  Examples with different arrangements of blue pixels (but the same count) would help clarify the influence on position.  The exact mapping from blue pixels to red pixel positions and their arrangement is still unclear.
