   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: a block of blue and white pixels with a central column of gray pixels. More blue than in example_1
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 6
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 0,1, color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,2, color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: 2,1, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue, white, and gray; output has white and red. Size drastically reduced
     transformation:
       - The output is a much smaller grid (3x3).
       - The number of blue pixels in the input seems to influence the pattern in the output.
       - The output contains three red pixels arranged in a plus (+) shape, symmetrically centered.
       - There's no obvious direct mapping of individual pixels.
       - The central column of gray pixels in the input might be significant.

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, several hypotheses emerge:


#. 
   **Size Reduction:** The output grid is consistently much smaller than the input.  A potential rule could involve taking the central region or a specific proportion of the input.

#. 
   **Color Transformation:** Gray pixels in the input might play a role in determining the location and quantity of red pixels in the output. The number of blue pixels might also play a role, as example 2 has more blue pixels than example 1, and correspondingly more red pixels in the output.

#. 
   **Symmetry:** The arrangement of red pixels in the output shows some symmetry (a central pixel and mirrored pixels above and below, or horizontally).

#. 
   **Central Region Focus:** The transformation appears to prioritize the central region or a core section of the input grid.

To test these hypotheses, I need more examples to solidify the transformation rule.  The relationship between the number of blue and gray pixels and the arrangement of red pixels in the output needs further clarification.  The exact size reduction method also needs to be determined (e.g., is it always a 3x3 output?).
