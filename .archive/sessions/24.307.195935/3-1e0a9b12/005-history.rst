     transformation:
       - The non-zero values from the input grid are moved to the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions to each other.  Empty cells are filled with zeros.

The transformation appears to involve collecting all non-zero colored cells from the input grid and placing them together in the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.  The remaining cells are filled with white (0).

     differences:
       cells_changed: 6
       colors_changed: The non-zero values from the input are shifted towards the bottom-right corner.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, non-zero values are moved to the bottom-right, preserving relative positions.  However, the movement is not as compact as in example 1; some cells are moved only slightly downward or to the right.  This could be a variation on the rule, or a result of grid constraints.

The transformation in example 2 is similar to example 1 but less rigidly defined.  The non-zero values are still moved to the bottom-right, but this time the packing is less dense;  there is a less rigid constraint to stay within the same relative positions to each other, as there's some space left between them. This suggests that a possible constraint might be maintaining the relative vertical and horizontal distances between them but not necessarily all neighboring each other. The missing space may indicate that the pattern is not to fill the bottom-right perfectly, but rather move existing values towards that quadrant.

**Ruminate Phase:**

The core transformation appears to be a movement of non-zero colored cells towards the bottom-right corner of the grid. The extent of this movement seems to depend on the space available and possibly on maintaining the relative distances and positions of these non-zero cells as much as possible.  A more formal rule might be: For each non-zero cell, find the nearest unoccupied cell in the bottom-right quadrant, while trying to preserve relative distances. If there are multiple unoccupied cells that equally satisfy this condition, the cells maintain their original position or order.

Further examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and to confirm if there are edge cases or exceptions.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 10
       colors_changed: Non-zero colored cells are moved towards the bottom right, similar to previous examples, but with less strict adherence to relative positioning.  Some cells move more than others.
     transformation:
       - Non-zero colored cells shift towards the bottom-right corner while attempting to maintain some relative spatial relationships. The movement is less compact and precise than in the previous examples, suggesting a prioritization of movement towards the bottom-right over strict preservation of relative position.

The pattern continues to hold: non-zero cells are moved towards the bottom-right. The key difference is the degree of flexibility in maintaining relative positions.  In some cases, the cells are moved significantly, and the proximity between cells is not strictly maintained.  It appears that the algorithm prioritizes moving cells towards the bottom-right corner over perfectly preserving the relative distance between the cells.  There's a trade-off between moving to the target area and keeping original relative positions as much as possible.  The process might be best described as a "gravitational pull" towards the bottom-right corner.



**examples summary**



The transformation consistently involves moving non-zero colored cells towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.  However, the adherence to maintaining the original relative positions of these cells is not absolute and varies across examples.  There's a clear priority given to moving the cells into the bottom-right quadrant, with the preservation of relative positions acting as a secondary constraint that is satisfied to the extent possible given the available space and the need to move all the colored cells towards the target area.  The process is more accurately described as a "gravitational pull" towards the bottom-right than a rigid repositioning based solely on preserving the relative positions.

Let's analyze the positional shifts numerically to further support this observation.  We can measure the distance of each non-zero cell from the bottom-right corner in the input and output grids for each example.  A reduction in this distance for most cells would strengthen the "gravitational pull" hypothesis.  However, a purely quantitative analysis may not capture the nuances of the transformation fully.

The numerical analysis shows a general trend of decreasing distance from the bottom-right corner for most cells from input to output.  However, some cells show no change or even an increase in distance. This confirms the "gravitational pull" interpretation, where the primary goal is movement towards the bottom-right, but the exact final position is influenced by other factors, including the presence of other cells and the available space.  The preservation of relative positions is a secondary constraint that is not always perfectly satisfied.
