The movement is less compact and precise than in the previous examples, suggesting a prioritization of movement towards the bottom-right over strict preservation of relative position.\n```\n\nThe pattern continues to hold: non-zero cells are moved towards the bottom-right. The key difference is the degree of flexibility in maintaining relative positions.  In some cases, the cells are moved significantly, and the proximity between cells is not strictly maintained.  It appears that the algorithm prioritizes moving cells towards the bottom-right corner over perfectly preserving the relative distance between the cells.  There's a trade-off between moving to the target area and keeping original relative positions as much as possible.  The process might be best described as a \"gravitational pull\" towards the bottom-right corner.\n"
