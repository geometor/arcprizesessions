However, the movement is not as compact as in example 1; some cells are moved only slightly downward or to the right.  This could be a variation on the rule, or a result of grid constraints.\n\n```\n\nThe transformation in example 2 is similar to example 1 but less rigidly defined.  The non-zero values are still moved to the bottom-right, but this time the packing is less dense;  there is a less rigid constraint to stay within the same relative positions to each other, as there's some space left between them. This suggests that a possible constraint might be maintaining the relative vertical and horizontal distances between them but not necessarily all neighboring each other. The missing space may indicate that the pattern is not to fill the bottom-right perfectly, but rather move existing values towards that quadrant.\n\n\n**Ruminate Phase:**\n\nThe core transformation appears to be a movement of non-zero colored cells towards the bottom-right corner of the grid. The extent of this movement seems to depend on the space available and possibly on maintaining the relative distances and positions of these non-zero cells as much as possible.  A more formal rule might be: For each non-zero cell, find the nearest unoccupied cell in the bottom-right quadrant, while trying to preserve relative distances. If there are multiple unoccupied cells that equally satisfy this condition, the cells maintain their original position or order.\n\nFurther examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and to confirm if there are edge cases or exceptions.\n"
