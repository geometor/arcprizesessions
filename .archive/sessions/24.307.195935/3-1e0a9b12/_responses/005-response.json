The issue is that the algorithm prioritizes filling the bottom-right quadrant without necessarily preserving the original distances.\n\n\nLet's refine it further.  We will need to carefully consider how to combine the gravitational pull towards the bottom-right with a constraint to maintain relative positions as closely as possible. A greedy algorithm might be insufficient; a more sophisticated approach might be necessary.  A possible approach would be to use a cost function that balances the distance from the bottom-right with the distortion of relative distances.   However, further examples are needed to precisely define the desired behavior and create a robust solution.  Given that this function is already computationally expensive, attempting to further optimize this for speed at this point would be premature.  Additional examples would be needed for more informed optimization.\n"
