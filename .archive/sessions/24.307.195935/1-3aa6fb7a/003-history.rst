**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
         - size: 2, position: (1,2), (5,4), color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.
     transformation:
       - It seems some 'azure' pixels are replaced with 'blue' pixels. The positions of the changed pixels are not immediately obvious.  Further examples are needed to determine the rule.

The transformation appears to selectively change some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The rule governing *which* azure pixels are changed is unclear from this single example. More examples are needed to understand the pattern and formulate a robust transformation rule.

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.
     transformation:
       - Some 'azure' pixels are replaced with 'blue' pixels. The positions of the changed pixels seem to be those 'azure' pixels which are not horizontally or vertically adjacent to another 'azure' pixel.

**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

Based on the two examples, a more refined hypothesis for the transformation is:  Azure (8) pixels that are *not* adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another azure pixel are changed to blue (1).  "Adjacent" means sharing a side, not just a corner.

**Further Testing Needed:**

To validate this hypothesis, further examples are needed, especially those that test edge cases:


#. 
   **Isolated Azure Pixels:** More examples with varying numbers and configurations of isolated azure pixels are necessary to confirm the transformation rule consistently applies.

#. 
   **Clusters of Azure Pixels:**  Examples with larger clusters of adjacent azure pixels would test the boundary conditions of the adjacency rule.

#. 
   **Different Grid Sizes:** Testing with different grid sizes would help ensure the rule is not size-dependent.

#. 
   **Azure Pixels at Edges:** The transformation of azure pixels located at the edges of the grid should also be tested.

#. 
   **Patterns and symmetry:**  Determine if there's a pattern in the selection of azure pixels that are transformed. Is it random, or is there an underlying algorithm at play?  (For instance, does it prioritize top/bottom, left/right, or diagonal positions?)

After reviewing more examples and performing these tests, a more definitive and accurate description of the transformation can be made.
