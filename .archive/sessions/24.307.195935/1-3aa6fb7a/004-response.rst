I apologize for the repeated errors in my previous attempts to code a solution. The task proved more complex than I initially estimated.  I'm still having trouble formulating a completely accurate rule for this transformation.  My previous attempts at coding a solution consistently failed to correctly predict the output for all the example cases provided.  I believe more examples are needed to fully understand the underlying logic.

The current hypothesis, that only isolated azure pixels change to blue, seems to be insufficiently precise. There might be additional conditions influencing the transformation.

To proceed effectively, I need more examples to refine my understanding of the pattern. The provided examples aren't sufficient to confidently develop a correct and robust algorithm.  The current code will only return the correct result in a few trivial cases, meaning the rule I've formulated is not complete.

To illustrate my struggles, here's an analysis of the 'test' input that highlights my uncertainties:

.. code-block:: yaml

   test_input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 38
       - 8: 12
     objects:
       - size: 12, position: scattered, color: azure
     transformation:
       - The pattern of transformation remains unclear.
       - My earlier hypothesis failed to correctly explain the transformations seen in the examples.

I've tried several coding approaches but they failed.  I need more data (more examples) to identify the precise transformation rule.
