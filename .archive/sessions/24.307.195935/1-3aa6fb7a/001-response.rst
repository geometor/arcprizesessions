Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
         - size: 2, position: (1,2), (5,4), color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.
     transformation:
       - It seems some 'azure' pixels are replaced with 'blue' pixels. The positions of the changed pixels are not immediately obvious.  Further examples are needed to determine the rule.

The transformation appears to selectively change some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The rule governing *which* azure pixels are changed is unclear from this single example. More examples are needed to understand the pattern and formulate a robust transformation rule.
