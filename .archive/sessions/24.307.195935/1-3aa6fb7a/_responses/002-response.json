The positions of the changed pixels seem to be those 'azure' pixels which are not horizontally or vertically adjacent to another 'azure' pixel.\n\n```\n\n**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**\n\nBased on the two examples, a more refined hypothesis for the transformation is:  Azure (8) pixels that are *not* adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another azure pixel are changed to blue (1).  \"Adjacent\" means sharing a side, not just a corner.\n\n\n**Further Testing Needed:**\n\nTo validate this hypothesis, further examples are needed, especially those that test edge cases:\n\n1. **Isolated Azure Pixels:** More examples with varying numbers and configurations of isolated azure pixels are necessary to confirm the transformation rule consistently applies.\n\n2. **Clusters of Azure Pixels:**  Examples with larger clusters of adjacent azure pixels would test the boundary conditions of the adjacency rule.\n\n3. **Different Grid Sizes:** Testing with different grid sizes would help ensure the rule is not size-dependent.\n\n4. **Azure Pixels at Edges:** The transformation of azure pixels located at the edges of the grid should also be tested.\n\n5. **Patterns and symmetry:**  Determine if there's a pattern in the selection of azure pixels that are transformed. Is it random, or is there an underlying algorithm at play?  (For instance, does it prioritize top/bottom, left/right, or diagonal positions?)\n\nAfter reviewing more examples and performing these tests, a more definitive and accurate description of the transformation can be made.\n"
