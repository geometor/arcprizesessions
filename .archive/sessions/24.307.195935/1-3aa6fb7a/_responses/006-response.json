My attempts to formulate and code a transformation rule based on limited examples have been unsuccessful. The rules are far more complex than I initially perceived.  To proceed, I strongly recommend obtaining more examples to better understand the underlying logic.  My previous attempts to create a python function have proven unreliable and ineffective due to the incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the transformation rules. I am unable to proceed further without additional data.\n"
