The positions of the changed pixels are not immediately obvious.  Further examples are needed to determine the rule.\n\n```\n\nThe transformation appears to selectively change some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The rule governing *which* azure pixels are changed is unclear from this single example. More examples are needed to understand the pattern and formulate a robust transformation rule.\n"
