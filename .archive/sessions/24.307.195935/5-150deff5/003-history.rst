Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 17
       objects:
         - size: 17, position: (1,2) to (6,7), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 75
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 17
       objects:
         - size: 17, position: (1,2) to (6,7), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 17
       colors_changed: Gray(5) pixels changed to Azure(8) and Red(2) pixels.  The shape of the gray object is preserved, but some of its pixels have changed color
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is mostly transformed into an azure object.
       - Some gray pixels (particularly in the lower part of the original object)  are replaced by red pixels.
       - The overall shape and size of the object remains similar
       - The spatial arrangement of the colors is closely related to the original gray shape's geometry.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple geometric operations (rotation, mirroring, etc.). Instead, it looks like a color replacement process guided by the shape of the original object.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and clarify if there is a rule determining which gray pixels become red vs. azure.  The distribution of red pixels suggests a possible relationship to the boundary of the initial gray object or possibly related to its proximity to the edge of the gray blob.

More examples are crucial to confirm the transformation rules and to determine if there are edge effects or other determining factors involved in the color replacements.

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 62
         - 5: 18
       objects:
         - size: 18, position: (1,1) to (7,7), color: gray #Approximated position
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 54
         - 2: 6
         - 8: 12
       objects:
         - size: 18, position: (1,1) to (7,7), color: mixture of azure and red #Approximated position
     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels changed to Azure (8) and Red (2) pixels. Shape is mostly preserved.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, gray pixels are replaced by azure and red.
       - The replacement pattern appears to follow the shape of the initial gray object.
       - Red pixels seem to appear more often along the edges and inner concave sections of the gray shape.

**Revised Thoughts:**

The transformation remains consistent across both examples:  a gray object is transformed, retaining its basic shape but with gray pixels replaced by azure and red pixels. The placement of red and azure pixels appears somewhat arbitrary, but there's a suggestion that red pixels might preferentially appear along the edges of the gray shape, or in concave regions.  The relative proportion of red vs. azure seems less predictable.

To strengthen my hypothesis and identify the precise rule governing the color transformation, additional examples are needed.  In particular, examples involving:


* Gray objects of different shapes and sizes are needed to understand how shape affects the transformation.
* Gray objects with more complex shapes (e.g., not simply connected) could reveal underlying rules.
* Gray objects with internal holes or disconnected components.
* Varying the size of the gray area will help discover scaling patterns or dependencies.
