Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 17
       objects:
         - size: 17, position: (1,2) to (6,7), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 75
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 17
       objects:
         - size: 17, position: (1,2) to (6,7), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 17
       colors_changed: Gray(5) pixels changed to Azure(8) and Red(2) pixels.  The shape of the gray object is preserved, but some of its pixels have changed color
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is mostly transformed into an azure object.
       - Some gray pixels (particularly in the lower part of the original object)  are replaced by red pixels.
       - The overall shape and size of the object remains similar
       - The spatial arrangement of the colors is closely related to the original gray shape's geometry.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple geometric operations (rotation, mirroring, etc.). Instead, it looks like a color replacement process guided by the shape of the original object.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and clarify if there is a rule determining which gray pixels become red vs. azure.  The distribution of red pixels suggests a possible relationship to the boundary of the initial gray object or possibly related to its proximity to the edge of the gray blob.

More examples are crucial to confirm the transformation rules and to determine if there are edge effects or other determining factors involved in the color replacements.
