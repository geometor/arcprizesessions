            "text": "Based on the three examples, the transformation rule appears to be a local replacement of gray pixels (5) with either azure (8) or red (2), depending on their proximity to the boundary of the contiguous gray region.  The transformation preserves the overall shape of the gray region.\n\nHere's a summary of my observations:\n\n* **Shape Preservation:** The original shape defined by the gray pixels is largely maintained in the output.  The overall size and outline remain similar.\n\n* **Color Replacement:** Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels.\n\n* **Edge Effect:** Red pixels (2) tend to appear along the perimeter or edges of the original gray shape,  and at concave sections.\n\n* **Interior Filling:** Azure pixels (8) fill the interior of the shape, replacing the remaining gray pixels after red pixels have been placed.\n\n* **No Simple Formula:**  There's no easily discernible mathematical formula to precisely predict the exact number of red vs. azure pixels. The placement appears to be algorithm-driven, not formula-based.\n\n**Hypothesis Refinement:**\n\nMy refined hypothesis is that the transformation involves a two-step process:\n\n1. **Edge Detection/Red Pixel Placement:** The algorithm identifies the boundary pixels of the contiguous gray region.  These boundary pixels (and possibly some pixels immediately adjacent in concave regions) are replaced by red pixels.\n\n2. **Interior Replacement:**  The remaining gray pixels in the interior are replaced by azure pixels.\n\n\n**Code Execution to Explore Patterns (Illustrative Example):**\n\nThe following code (in Python) demonstrates a simple way to explore the edge effect using one of the examples.  A more sophisticated analysis would require a more advanced image processing technique. This is just to illustrate that edge identification is computationally feasible.\n\n"

A more robust edge detection algorithm (e.g., using OpenCV) would be necessary for more complex shapes, but this simple example illustrates the feasibility of detecting boundary pixels, which are crucial to my hypothesis.  This supports the idea that the transformation might involve an edge detection step followed by interior filling.  More examples with varied shapes are needed to test this algorithm more rigorously.\n"
