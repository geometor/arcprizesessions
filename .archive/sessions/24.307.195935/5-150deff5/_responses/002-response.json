Shape is mostly preserved.\n  transformation:\n    - Similar to example_1, gray pixels are replaced by azure and red.\n    - The replacement pattern appears to follow the shape of the initial gray object.\n    - Red pixels seem to appear more often along the edges and inner concave sections of the gray shape.\n```\n\n**Revised Thoughts:**\n\nThe transformation remains consistent across both examples:  a gray object is transformed, retaining its basic shape but with gray pixels replaced by azure and red pixels. The placement of red and azure pixels appears somewhat arbitrary, but there's a suggestion that red pixels might preferentially appear along the edges of the gray shape, or in concave regions.  The relative proportion of red vs. azure seems less predictable.\n\nTo strengthen my hypothesis and identify the precise rule governing the color transformation, additional examples are needed.  In particular, examples involving:\n\n- Gray objects of different shapes and sizes are needed to understand how shape affects the transformation.\n- Gray objects with more complex shapes (e.g., not simply connected) could reveal underlying rules.\n- Gray objects with internal holes or disconnected components.\n- Varying the size of the gray area will help discover scaling patterns or dependencies.\n\n\n"
