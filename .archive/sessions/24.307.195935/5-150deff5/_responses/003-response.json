The overall shape of the gray region is preserved. Red pixels appear to be preferentially located along the edges and in concave areas of the original gray shape, while azure pixels fill in the interior. The exact number of red vs. azure pixels appears somewhat variable, but the general pattern is highly consistent.  There is not a straightforward mathematical formula to describe it but rather an algorithm based on proximity and geometry.  The algorithm prioritizes the color red for pixels near the edge of the original grey area.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a conditional replacement based on the position of the gray pixel within its contiguous region.  A pixel is more likely to be replaced by red if it's adjacent to a white pixel.  Azure replaces the remaining interior gray pixels.\n\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo confirm the hypothesis, more examples are needed, particularly focusing on:\n\n1.  **Edge cases:**  Examples with more irregular shapes, thin gray lines, and disconnected components of the gray regions.\n2.  **Size and Scale:** Examining the transformation with different sizes and scales of the grey object to see if there are any scaling dependencies or rule changes.\n3.  **Internal Holes:** Testing with gray objects containing holes to determine if the algorithm prioritizes the outer contour.\n\nThese additional examples would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm and enable a more confident prediction of output for a new input.\n"
