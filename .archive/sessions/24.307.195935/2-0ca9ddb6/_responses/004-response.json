            "text": "The transformation rule consistently involves adding 2x2 crosses of yellow around red pixels and orange crosses around blue pixels.  Other colors remain unchanged. The crosses are centered on the original pixel and do not overlap.  Edge cases show that the cross pattern is truncated if it extends beyond the grid boundary.  The transformation is independent for each red and blue pixel, meaning multiple instances of these colors result in multiple, separate cross additions.\n\n\nLet's summarize the findings from the provided examples:\n\n- **Red Pixels:** Each red pixel in the input grid results in the addition of a 2x2 yellow cross (color 4) centered on the red pixel in the output grid.  The cross is oriented such that the original red pixel is in the center.\n\n- **Blue Pixels:** Similarly, each blue pixel results in a 2x2 orange cross (color 7) in the output grid.\n\n- **Other Colors:** All other colors (0, 6, 8, etc.) in the input grid remain unchanged in their position and color in the output grid.\n\n- **Overlap:**  The cross patterns do not overlap; each red or blue pixel receives its own independent cross pattern.\n\n- **Edge Handling:** If a cross pattern would extend beyond the grid boundaries, it is truncated to remain within the grid.\n\n\nThis consistent pattern across examples strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation is purely based on the presence and location of red and blue pixels, independently generating cross patterns around them.  No other discernible rules or patterns were observed.\n"
