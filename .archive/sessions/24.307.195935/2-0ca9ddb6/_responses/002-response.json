The rule is:\n\n1.  For each red pixel, a 2x2 yellow cross is added around it.\n2.  For each blue pixel, a 2x2 orange cross is added around it.\n3.  The crosses do not overlap or interact with each other.  They are independently generated for each red or blue pixel.\n4.  The cross patterns are handled correctly at the edges, as the pattern is truncated when it would extend beyond the bounds of the grid.\n\n\nTo further validate this refined hypothesis, I would suggest testing the following scenarios:\n\n- A larger grid to show that the cross patterns are independent.\n- Multiple red or blue pixels in close proximity, to confirm non-overlapping behavior.\n- Red and blue pixels very close to the edge of the grid, to demonstrate edge handling.\n- Test other colors to determine if they are also affected by this transformation.\n\n\n\n"
