Existing red and blue remain.\n  transformation:\n    - The red and blue pixels remain in the same location.\n    - Yellow pixels appear in a cross pattern around the red pixel.\n    - Orange pixels appear in a cross pattern around the blue pixel.\n    - The number of added yellow and orange pixels is 4 each.\n\n```\n\n**Initial Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation appears to be a rule-based addition of pixels around specific existing colors. Red results in a yellow cross, and blue results in an orange cross.  The cross pattern is always 2x2 in size.\n\n\nFurther examples are needed to confirm or refine this hypothesis.  Specifically, we need to check:\n\n- What happens if there are multiple red or blue pixels? Do they each get their own cross pattern?\n- What happens if red and blue pixels are adjacent? Does the pattern overlap or change?\n- What happens if the red or blue pixels are on the edge of the grid? How are the patterns adjusted?\n- Are there any other colours which cause transformations?\n\nThe next example(s) should help clarify these uncertainties.\n"
