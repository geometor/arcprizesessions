Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 71
         - 1: 1
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 63
         - 1: 1
         - 2: 1
         - 4: 4
         - 7: 4
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1),(2,3),(4,1),(4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5),(6,7),(7,5),(7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Existing red and blue remain.
     transformation:
       - The red and blue pixels remain in the same location.
       - Yellow pixels appear in a cross pattern around the red pixel.
       - Orange pixels appear in a cross pattern around the blue pixel.
       - The number of added yellow and orange pixels is 4 each.

**Initial Hypothesis:**

The transformation appears to be a rule-based addition of pixels around specific existing colors. Red results in a yellow cross, and blue results in an orange cross.  The cross pattern is always 2x2 in size.

Further examples are needed to confirm or refine this hypothesis.  Specifically, we need to check:


* What happens if there are multiple red or blue pixels? Do they each get their own cross pattern?
* What happens if red and blue pixels are adjacent? Does the pattern overlap or change?
* What happens if the red or blue pixels are on the edge of the grid? How are the patterns adjusted?
* Are there any other colours which cause transformations?

The next example(s) should help clarify these uncertainties.

         - size: 2x2, positions: [(7,1),(7,3),(8,1),(8,3)], color: yellow


     differences:
       cells_changed: 20
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange around blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - Red and blue pixels remain in the same location.
       - Yellow pixels appear in a cross pattern around red pixels.
       - Orange pixels appear in a cross pattern around blue pixels.
       - Multiple instances of red and blue each get their own cross pattern.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

The transformation continues to hold.  The rule is:


#. For each red pixel, a 2x2 yellow cross is added around it.
#. For each blue pixel, a 2x2 orange cross is added around it.
#. The crosses do not overlap or interact with each other.  They are independently generated for each red or blue pixel.
#. The cross patterns are handled correctly at the edges, as the pattern is truncated when it would extend beyond the bounds of the grid.

To further validate this refined hypothesis, I would suggest testing the following scenarios:


* A larger grid to show that the cross patterns are independent.
* Multiple red or blue pixels in close proximity, to confirm non-overlapping behavior.
* Red and blue pixels very close to the edge of the grid, to demonstrate edge handling.
* Test other colors to determine if they are also affected by this transformation.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange around red and blue pixels.
     transformation:
       - Red pixels get a yellow cross.
       - Blue pixels get an orange cross.
       - Magenta pixel remains unchanged.

The pattern is consistent with the previous examples.  Only red and blue pixels trigger the addition of yellow and orange cross patterns, respectively.  Other colors remain unaffected.  The hypothesis remains valid.  The next step is to proceed to the test phase.



**examples summary**



The transformation rule consistently involves adding 2x2 crosses of yellow around red pixels and orange crosses around blue pixels.  Other colors remain unchanged. The crosses are centered on the original pixel and do not overlap.  Edge cases show that the cross pattern is truncated if it extends beyond the grid boundary.  The transformation is independent for each red and blue pixel, meaning multiple instances of these colors result in multiple, separate cross additions.

Let's summarize the findings from the provided examples:


* 
  **Red Pixels:** Each red pixel in the input grid results in the addition of a 2x2 yellow cross (color 4) centered on the red pixel in the output grid.  The cross is oriented such that the original red pixel is in the center.

* 
  **Blue Pixels:** Similarly, each blue pixel results in a 2x2 orange cross (color 7) in the output grid.

* 
  **Other Colors:** All other colors (0, 6, 8, etc.) in the input grid remain unchanged in their position and color in the output grid.

* 
  **Overlap:**  The cross patterns do not overlap; each red or blue pixel receives its own independent cross pattern.

* 
  **Edge Handling:** If a cross pattern would extend beyond the grid boundaries, it is truncated to remain within the grid.

This consistent pattern across examples strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation is purely based on the presence and location of red and blue pixels, independently generating cross patterns around them.  No other discernible rules or patterns were observed.
