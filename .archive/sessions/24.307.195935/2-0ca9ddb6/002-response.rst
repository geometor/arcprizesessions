     differences:
       cells_changed: 20
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange around blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - Red and blue pixels remain in the same location.
       - Yellow pixels appear in a cross pattern around red pixels.
       - Orange pixels appear in a cross pattern around blue pixels.
       - Multiple instances of red and blue each get their own cross pattern.

**Refined Hypothesis:**

The transformation continues to hold.  The rule is:


#. For each red pixel, a 2x2 yellow cross is added around it.
#. For each blue pixel, a 2x2 orange cross is added around it.
#. The crosses do not overlap or interact with each other.  They are independently generated for each red or blue pixel.
#. The cross patterns are handled correctly at the edges, as the pattern is truncated when it would extend beyond the bounds of the grid.

To further validate this refined hypothesis, I would suggest testing the following scenarios:


* A larger grid to show that the cross patterns are independent.
* Multiple red or blue pixels in close proximity, to confirm non-overlapping behavior.
* Red and blue pixels very close to the edge of the grid, to demonstrate edge handling.
* Test other colors to determine if they are also affected by this transformation.
