**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except for two azure (8) pixels that are changed to blue (1) pixels.  These blue pixels appear to be located at the bottom right of the azure cluster.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Indices where grids differ: {diff}")

   print(f"Input Grid:\n{input_grid}")
   print(f"Output Grid:\n{output_grid}")

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 3, position: (1,1), color: azure
       - size: 2, position: (4,4), color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - The transformation replaces two of the bottom-most azure pixels with blue pixels.  The selection seems arbitrary but is consistent within the example.

Based on the analysis, a possible natural language program for this transformation could be: "Identify the cluster of azure pixels.  Replace the two bottom-most azure pixels within the cluster with blue pixels."  However, this description is imprecise because it doesn't clearly define "bottom-most" in cases with multiple candidates at the same level. A more robust program would need a formal definition for pixel selection within the cluster.  More examples are needed to refine this.

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
