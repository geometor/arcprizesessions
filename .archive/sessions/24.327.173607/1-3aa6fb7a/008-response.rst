008 â€¢ Response
==============


The changes made to the working output grid are consistent with the observed pattern in previous examples: replacing a subset of azure pixels with blue pixels. Specifically, one azure pixel from the perimeter of each cluster has been changed to blue.

Let's use code execution to analyze some properties:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from scipy import ndimage

   working_grid = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   def find_clusters(grid):
       labeled_grid, num_features = ndimage.label(grid)
       clusters = []
       for label in range(1, num_features + 1):
           cluster_indices = np.where(labeled_grid == label)
           cluster = {
               'indices': (cluster_indices[0], cluster_indices[1]),
               'size': len(cluster_indices[0])
           }
           clusters.append(cluster)
       return clusters

   clusters = find_clusters(working_grid == 8)
   print(f"Clusters in the working grid: {clusters}")

   # Count of blue pixels
   blue_count = np.count_nonzero(working_grid == 1)
   print(f"Number of blue pixels: {blue_count}")

   # Count of azure pixels
   azure_count = np.count_nonzero(working_grid == 8)
   print(f"Number of azure pixels: {azure_count}")

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Clusters in the working grid: [{'indices': (array([0, 1]), array([6, 6])), 'size': 2}, {'indices': (array([1]), array([1])), 'size': 1}, {'indices': (array([2]), array([0])), 'size': 1}, {'indices': (array([4, 4]), array([3, 4])), 'size': 2}, {'indices': (array([6, 6]), array([0, 1])), 'size': 2}]
   Number of blue pixels: 4
   Number of azure pixels: 10

The code confirms that the working grid now has four blue pixels (one in each of the originally identified clusters) and 10 azure pixels.  The number of blue pixels is equal to the number of clusters in the input grid where azure pixels existed. This strengthens the hypothesis that one perimeter pixel per cluster of azure pixels is being replaced with blue.  However, the exact selection of which perimeter pixel is still undefined.  Additional examples are still needed to improve confidence in the hypothesis.  The output is consistent with the pattern observed so far, but lacks the precision for a fully defined and robust transformation rule.
