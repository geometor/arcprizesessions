The working output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.  This is correct; the transformation doesn't add or remove pixels, only changes their color.

The changes made to the working output grid align with the transformation rule established earlier:  Azure (8) pixels that are on the outer edge of their connected component and adjacent to a white (0) pixel are changed to blue (1).

Let's use code execution to verify this, specifically focusing on the number of changed cells and their coordinates:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                         [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                         [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = input_grid - output_grid
   print("Difference Grid:\n", diff_grid)

   changed_cells = np.count_nonzero(diff_grid)
   print("Number of changed cells:", changed_cells)

   print("Coordinates of changed cells:")
   rows, cols = np.where(diff_grid != 0)
   for i in range(len(rows)):
       print(f"({rows[i]}, {cols[i]})")

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Difference Grid:
    [[ 0  0  0  0  0  1  0]
    [ 1  1  0  0  0  0  1]
    [ 1  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  1  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  1  1  0  0]
    [ 0  1  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 1  1  0  0  0  0  0]]
   Number of changed cells: 12
   Coordinates of changed cells:
   (0, 5)
   (1, 0)
   (1, 1)
   (1, 6)
   (2, 0)
   (3, 3)
   (4, 3)
   (4, 4)
   (5, 1)
   (6, 0)
   (6, 1)

The code confirms that 12 cells have changed. This is consistent with the visual inspection and the application of the transformation rule to the input grid. The coordinates of the changed cells also match the expected locations based on the rule.  The transformation is correctly applied.
