The transformation rule in both examples is consistent:  Azure (8) pixels that are adjacent to white (0) pixels and are on the outer edge of a connected cluster of azure pixels are changed to blue (1) pixels.  "Edge" means the azure pixel is directly adjacent to at least one white pixel (horizontally or vertically). "Cluster" means a group of connected azure pixels;  two azure pixels are considered connected if they share a side (horizontally or vertically).

Let's create a more robust Python function to verify this transformation rule.  The function will identify connected components, determine edge pixels within each component, and then perform the color change.

The ``transform_grid`` function correctly identifies connected components of azure pixels and changes the edge pixels (adjacent to white) to blue, matching the observed transformation in the examples.  The DFS algorithm efficiently handles clusters of varying shapes and sizes.  This provides a robust and accurate representation of the transformation rule.
