The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a somewhat L-shape. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  These changes seem to follow the same pattern as in example 1:  azure pixels on the outer edge of the cluster, adjacent to white pixels, are changed to blue.

       - size: 3, position: (1,4), (2,3), (5,3), color: blue - single pixels
   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The natural language program remains the same as for example 1: Find all azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel and are on the outer edge of the connected azure cluster. Change these pixels to blue.  "Edge" means they touch a white pixel. "Cluster" refers to contiguous connected azure pixels.
