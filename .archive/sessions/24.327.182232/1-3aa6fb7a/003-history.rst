**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel and are at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The natural language program for the transformation is:  Find all azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel and are on the outer edge of the connected azure cluster. Change these pixels to blue.  "Edge" means they touch a white pixel. "Cluster" refers to contiguous connected azure pixels.

**observations**


    


    

The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a somewhat L-shape. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  These changes seem to follow the same pattern as in example 1:  azure pixels on the outer edge of the cluster, adjacent to white pixels, are changed to blue.


    


    

code_execution:


    


    

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = input_grid - output_grid
   print("Difference Grid:\n", diff_grid)

   changed_cells = np.count_nonzero(diff_grid)
   print("Number of changed cells:", changed_cells)

   print("Coordinates of changed cells:")
   rows, cols = np.where(diff_grid != 0)
   for i in range(len(rows)):
       print(f"({rows[i]}, {cols[i]})")

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The natural language program remains the same as for example 1: Find all azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel and are on the outer edge of the connected azure cluster. Change these pixels to blue.  "Edge" means they touch a white pixel. "Cluster" refers to contiguous connected azure pixels.
