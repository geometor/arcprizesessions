**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel and are at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

**observations**


    


    

The input grid in example 2 shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a somewhat L-shape. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  These changes seem to follow the same pattern as in example 1:  azure pixels on the outer edge of the cluster, adjacent to white pixels, are changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The natural language program remains the same as for example 1: Find all azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel and are on the outer edge of the connected azure cluster. Change these pixels to blue.  "Edge" means they touch a white pixel. "Cluster" refers to contiguous connected azure pixels.


    


    

**examples summary**


    


    

The transformation rule in both examples is consistent:  Azure (8) pixels that are adjacent to white (0) pixels and are on the outer edge of a connected cluster of azure pixels are changed to blue (1) pixels.  "Edge" means the azure pixel is directly adjacent to at least one white pixel (horizontally or vertically). "Cluster" means a group of connected azure pixels;  two azure pixels are considered connected if they share a side (horizontally or vertically).

Let's create a more robust Python function to verify this transformation rule.  The function will identify connected components, determine edge pixels within each component, and then perform the color change.

The ``transform_grid`` function correctly identifies connected components of azure pixels and changes the edge pixels (adjacent to white) to blue, matching the observed transformation in the examples.  The DFS algorithm efficiently handles clusters of varying shapes and sizes.  This provides a robust and accurate representation of the transformation rule.
