**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel and are at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

       - size: 2, position: (1,2), (4,4), color: blue - single pixels
   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels at the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.

The natural language program for the transformation is:  Find all azure pixels that are adjacent to a white pixel and are on the outer edge of the connected azure cluster. Change these pixels to blue.  "Edge" means they touch a white pixel. "Cluster" refers to contiguous connected azure pixels.

INSTRUCTIONS:


    


    


* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
