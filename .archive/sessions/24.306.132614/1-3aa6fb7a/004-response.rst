Here's a report analyzing the test input and proposing a solution based on the observed patterns in the examples:

**Test Input Analysis:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (33)
    *   8: (11)
*   objects:
    *   There are two distinct clusters of 'azure' (8) pixels. One larger cluster at the top-right and bottom-left, and a smaller, isolated cluster at the center-left.  Isolated pixels also exist at the top left of the larger cluster.  This complexity introduces the need to potentially distinguish between clusters and single pixels.


**Proposed Solution Strategy:**

Based on the previous analysis of examples 1 and 2, we'll develop a python function to identify azure clusters and add blue pixels according to the observed rules. The strategy involves several steps:

1.  **Cluster Identification:**  Use a connected component labeling algorithm to identify distinct clusters of 'azure' (8) pixels.  This will differentiate between isolated pixels and clusters, solving the complexity of detecting clusters.

2.  **Extrema Determination:** For each cluster, determine the bounding box, and identify the extreme points (top, bottom, left, right) and determine adjacency.

3.  **Blue Pixel Placement:** For larger clusters, add 'blue' (1) pixels at the extreme points and/or adjacent to the extremal points. For smaller clusters or isolated pixels, potentially modify the rule and add pixels according to a different strategy (e.g., a simpler addition based on adjacency) or choose to ignore them based on further analysis.


**Python Implementation (Illustrative):**

This code is an illustrative example of the connected component labeling and a simplified approach for placing blue pixels, suitable for demonstrating the approach:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from scipy.ndimage import label
    
    def solve_puzzle(input_grid):
        # Identify azure (8) clusters
        labeled_array, num_features = label(input_grid == 8)
    
        output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
        for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
            cluster_indices = np.where(labeled_array == label_num)
            cluster_rows = cluster_indices[0]
            cluster_cols = cluster_indices[1]
    
            min_row, max_row = np.min(cluster_rows), np.max(cluster_rows)
            min_col, max_col = np.min(cluster_cols), np.max(cluster_cols)
            
            #Simplified approach for demonstration
            if (max_row - min_row) > 1 and (max_col-min_col) > 1:  # Condition for clusters of certain size
                output_grid[min_row, min_col] = 1  #Add to Top Left
                output_grid[max_row, max_col] = 1  #Add to Bottom Right
                
            
    
        return output_grid
    
    
    input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    output_grid = solve_puzzle(input_grid)
    print(output_grid)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

The provided code only performs connected component labeling but does not add the blue pixels as intended.  The current output is identical to the input.  The addition of blue pixels based on the extrema or adjacency of clusters requires further refinement of the code.  The simplification in the code was to demonstrate the connected component labeling.  Additional logic is required to determine the placement of blue pixels based on the shape of the cluster, which is more complex.  This will require additional refinement of the code to handle cases of single pixels and clusters of different shapes.
