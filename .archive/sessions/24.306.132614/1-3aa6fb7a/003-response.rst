The transformation in both examples involves adding blue (1) pixels to the input grid, which contains a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The placement of the new blue pixels, however, appears to depend on the shape of the azure cluster.

**Example 1:**  Two blue pixels are added at the extreme corners of the bounding box that encloses the azure cluster. This creates a sort of "expansion" of the cluster's area.

**Example 2:** Four blue pixels are added, one adjacent to each of the outermost azure pixels.  This suggests a "border" or "padding" around the cluster.

The rule isn't purely geometric or easily expressed as a simple mathematical formula.  It's a procedural rule that seems to consider the *shape* of the azure cluster.  Therefore, a code-based approach that analyzes the cluster's geometry, and based on this analysis, places blue pixels strategically is the best path to a general solution.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.  It might require detecting connected components of azure pixels and their bounds.

To investigate further, I'd like to use code to analyze the location of the azure clusters and the added blue pixels relative to the clusters' extents and adjacency.  I will also attempt to quantify "cluster shape" to check for correlations with added pixel locations.
