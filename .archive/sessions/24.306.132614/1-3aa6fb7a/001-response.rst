Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 'azure' pixels forming a loose, somewhat irregular shape.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Two 'blue' pixels appear. One to the upper right of the topmost azure pixel and one to the lower left of the bottommost azure pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue' pixels.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve the addition of two 'blue' pixels. These new pixels seem to be positioned at the upper-right and lower-left extremes of the existing 'azure' pixel cluster, acting almost like an expansion of the cluster's bounding box.  There is no obvious mathematical or geometric pattern to this transformation. More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
