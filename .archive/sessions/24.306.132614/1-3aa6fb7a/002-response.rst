Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a synthesis of both examples:


**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of eight 'azure' pixels arranged in an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (34)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (4)
*   objects:
    *   The azure cluster remains.
    *   Four 'blue' pixels have appeared, one adjacent to each of the four extreme points of the azure cluster (top, bottom, left, right).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 4
*   colors_changed: Four 'white' pixels changed to 'blue' pixels.


**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, 'blue' pixels are added. However, here, the addition of the blue pixels appear to be directly adjacent to each of the outermost 'azure' pixels.  This suggests a different rule than in Example 1.


**Synthesis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show the addition of 'blue' pixels, but the placement differs. In Example 1 the new pixels are at the extrema of the bounding box of the azure cluster.  In example 2, the blue pixels directly border on the azure pixels.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation likely involves identifying a cluster of 'azure' pixels (color 8). The algorithm then adds one or more 'blue' pixels (color 1) based on the cluster's shape.  The specific placement of these new blue pixels appears to depend on the cluster's structure and could vary.  This isn't easily represented by a mathematical function, but may be describable through a procedural approach using geometric analysis to identify the extremal pixels in the cluster.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.  The rules may need to distinguish between the isolated azure pixels and the 'cluster'.
