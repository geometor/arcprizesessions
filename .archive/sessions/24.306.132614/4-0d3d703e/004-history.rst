Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors green, blue, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors yellow, gray, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors (green to yellow, blue to gray, red to magenta).  The replacement pattern appears to be a simple addition of 1 to each original value (modulo 10).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of each color with another color, following a sequential shift:  3 becomes 4, 1 becomes 5, and 2 becomes 6.  This suggests a consistent numerical mapping.


**Initial Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a simple arithmetic operation on the numerical representation of colors.  The next step would be to test this hypothesis on additional examples to determine if this is a universal rule or a specific pattern only in this example.  The modulo operator might be involved to wrap around color values 0-9.

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors red, green, and azure, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors magenta, yellow, and maroon, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed.  Red (2) becomes magenta (6), green (3) becomes yellow (4), and azure (8) becomes maroon (9).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation again seems to be a color mapping, but not a simple additive shift like in Example 1.  The mapping is not immediately obvious from a simple arithmetic operation.  However, it seems there's a consistent pattern for each color.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation is a color mapping, but the mapping isn't a simple arithmetic function. It's more complex and likely involves a lookup table or a specific rule set for mapping each input color to an output color.

**Overall Pattern:**

Combining both examples, it appears that the core transformation is a mapping of input colors to output colors. This mapping is consistent across the entire grid and is not dependent on the spatial arrangement of colors. Further examples are needed to confirm or refine this hypothesis and to determine the exact mapping rule.

**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors gray, azure, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors blue, maroon, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed. Gray (5) becomes blue (1), azure (8) becomes maroon (9), and magenta (6) becomes red (2).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation is again a color mapping, showing a consistent pattern. There's no simple arithmetic relation.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation is a fixed color mapping. Each input color has a corresponding output color.  Let's create a mapping table based on the three examples.

| Input Color | Output Color |
|---|---|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 2 |
| 8 | 9 |


This table summarizes the transformations observed in all three examples.  It seems to be a bijective function (one-to-one mapping).  No obvious mathematical rule emerges except the function itself.  Further examples might reveal a pattern, but at this point, it appears we need to treat this as a fixed mapping.

To use this in code, we could implement it as a dictionary.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

Based on the three examples, I've created a Python dictionary `color_map` which represents the transformation rule.  The keys are the input colors, and the values are the corresponding output colors.  This dictionary encapsulates the observed pattern.  I'll use this dictionary to process the test input.
