**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors gray, azure, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors blue, maroon, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed. Gray (5) becomes blue (1), azure (8) becomes maroon (9), and magenta (6) becomes red (2).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation is again a color mapping, showing a consistent pattern. There's no simple arithmetic relation.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation is a fixed color mapping. Each input color has a corresponding output color.  Let's create a mapping table based on the three examples.

| Input Color | Output Color |
|---|---|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 2 |
| 8 | 9 |


This table summarizes the transformations observed in all three examples.  It seems to be a bijective function (one-to-one mapping).  No obvious mathematical rule emerges except the function itself.  Further examples might reveal a pattern, but at this point, it appears we need to treat this as a fixed mapping.

To use this in code, we could implement it as a dictionary.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

Based on the three examples, I've created a Python dictionary `color_map` which represents the transformation rule.  The keys are the input colors, and the values are the corresponding output colors.  This dictionary encapsulates the observed pattern.  I'll use this dictionary to process the test input.
