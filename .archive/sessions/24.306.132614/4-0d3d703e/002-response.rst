**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors red, green, and azure, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors magenta, yellow, and maroon, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed.  Red (2) becomes magenta (6), green (3) becomes yellow (4), and azure (8) becomes maroon (9).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation again seems to be a color mapping, but not a simple additive shift like in Example 1.  The mapping is not immediately obvious from a simple arithmetic operation.  However, it seems there's a consistent pattern for each color.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation is a color mapping, but the mapping isn't a simple arithmetic function. It's more complex and likely involves a lookup table or a specific rule set for mapping each input color to an output color.

**Overall Pattern:**

Combining both examples, it appears that the core transformation is a mapping of input colors to output colors. This mapping is consistent across the entire grid and is not dependent on the spatial arrangement of colors. Further examples are needed to confirm or refine this hypothesis and to determine the exact mapping rule.
