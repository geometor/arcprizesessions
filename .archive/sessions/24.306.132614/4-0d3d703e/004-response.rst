**Example 4**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors maroon, yellow, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors azure, green, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed. Maroon (9) becomes azure (8), yellow (4) becomes green (3), and red (2) becomes magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation is a color mapping, consistent with previous examples.

**Updated color mapping:**

Let's update the `color_map` dictionary to include the mappings from Example 4:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        4:3,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9,
        9:8
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

The updated `color_map` now includes all the observed color mappings from the four examples.  This dictionary will be used to predict the output for the test input.  The transformation seems to be a consistent, deterministic mapping of input colors to output colors.  There's no readily apparent mathematical formula governing the transformation beyond the mapping itself.
