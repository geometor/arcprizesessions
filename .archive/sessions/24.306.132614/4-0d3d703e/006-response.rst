Here's a report analyzing the test input and applying the derived transformation rule:

**Test Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   3: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors azure, blue, and green, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Predicted Output (based on color_map):**

Using the `color_map` dictionary developed from the examples, we can predict the output:

code_execution:
```python
color_map = {
    1: 5,
    2: 6,
    3: 4,
    4: 3,
    5: 1,
    6: 2,
    8: 9,
    9: 8
}

input_grid = [[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]
output_grid = [[color_map[pixel] for pixel in row] for row in input_grid]
print(output_grid)

```
code_execution_result:
```
[[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]
```

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   4: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors maroon, gray, and yellow, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Transformation:**

The transformation applied to the test input is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples. Each color in the input grid is mapped to its corresponding color in the `color_map` dictionary, resulting in the predicted output grid.


**Conclusion:**

The solution to this puzzle is a simple color mapping based on a lookup table. The `color_map` dictionary accurately predicts the output based on the examples and the test input. No other spatial or arithmetic operations were involved. The solution reflects a consistent and deterministic transformation across all examples provided.
