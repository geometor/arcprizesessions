The transformation applied to the input grids to produce the output grids in examples 1-4 is a consistent, deterministic mapping of input colors to output colors. This mapping is not based on a simple arithmetic operation, but rather a fixed, bijective function (one-to-one correspondence).  There is no obvious mathematical formula describing this mapping beyond the mapping itself.  The mapping can be represented as a lookup table or dictionary.

The following `color_map` dictionary summarizes the observed mappings:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        4: 3,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9,
        9: 8
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

This dictionary can be used to transform any input grid by looking up each pixel's color in the `color_map` and replacing it with its corresponding value. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the grid remains unchanged; only the color values are transformed according to this fixed mapping.
