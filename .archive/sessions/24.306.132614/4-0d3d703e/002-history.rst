Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors green, blue, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors yellow, gray, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors (green to yellow, blue to gray, red to magenta).  The replacement pattern appears to be a simple addition of 1 to each original value (modulo 10).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of each color with another color, following a sequential shift:  3 becomes 4, 1 becomes 5, and 2 becomes 6.  This suggests a consistent numerical mapping.


**Initial Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a simple arithmetic operation on the numerical representation of colors.  The next step would be to test this hypothesis on additional examples to determine if this is a universal rule or a specific pattern only in this example.  The modulo operator might be involved to wrap around color values 0-9.
