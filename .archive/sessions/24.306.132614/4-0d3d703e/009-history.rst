Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   3: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors green, blue, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   4: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors yellow, gray, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors (green to yellow, blue to gray, red to magenta).  The replacement pattern appears to be a simple addition of 1 to each original value (modulo 10).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of each color with another color, following a sequential shift:  3 becomes 4, 1 becomes 5, and 2 becomes 6.  This suggests a consistent numerical mapping.


**Initial Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves a simple arithmetic operation on the numerical representation of colors.  The next step would be to test this hypothesis on additional examples to determine if this is a universal rule or a specific pattern only in this example.  The modulo operator might be involved to wrap around color values 0-9.

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   2: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   8: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors red, green, and azure, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   6: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   9: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors magenta, yellow, and maroon, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed.  Red (2) becomes magenta (6), green (3) becomes yellow (4), and azure (8) becomes maroon (9).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation again seems to be a color mapping, but not a simple additive shift like in Example 1.  The mapping is not immediately obvious from a simple arithmetic operation.  However, it seems there's a consistent pattern for each color.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation is a color mapping, but the mapping isn't a simple arithmetic function. It's more complex and likely involves a lookup table or a specific rule set for mapping each input color to an output color.

**Overall Pattern:**

Combining both examples, it appears that the core transformation is a mapping of input colors to output colors. This mapping is consistent across the entire grid and is not dependent on the spatial arrangement of colors. Further examples are needed to confirm or refine this hypothesis and to determine the exact mapping rule.

**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   5: 3
    *   8: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors gray, azure, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   1: 3
    *   9: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors blue, maroon, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed. Gray (5) becomes blue (1), azure (8) becomes maroon (9), and magenta (6) becomes red (2).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation is again a color mapping, showing a consistent pattern. There's no simple arithmetic relation.


**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation is a fixed color mapping. Each input color has a corresponding output color.  Let's create a mapping table based on the three examples.

| Input Color | Output Color |
|---|---|
| 1 | 5 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 2 |
| 8 | 9 |


This table summarizes the transformations observed in all three examples.  It seems to be a bijective function (one-to-one mapping).  No obvious mathematical rule emerges except the function itself.  Further examples might reveal a pattern, but at this point, it appears we need to treat this as a fixed mapping.

To use this in code, we could implement it as a dictionary.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

Based on the three examples, I've created a Python dictionary `color_map` which represents the transformation rule.  The keys are the input colors, and the values are the corresponding output colors.  This dictionary encapsulates the observed pattern.  I'll use this dictionary to process the test input.

**example_4**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[9 4 2]
     [9 4 2]
     [9 4 2]]

**observations**

**Example 4**

**Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   4: 3
    *   2: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors maroon, yellow, and red, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   3: 3
    *   6: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors azure, green, and magenta, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 9
*   colors_changed: All cells changed. Maroon (9) becomes azure (8), yellow (4) becomes green (3), and red (2) becomes magenta (6).

**Transformation:**

*   The transformation is a color mapping, consistent with previous examples.

**Updated color mapping:**

Let's update the `color_map` dictionary to include the mappings from Example 4:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        4:3,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9,
        9:8
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

The updated `color_map` now includes all the observed color mappings from the four examples.  This dictionary will be used to predict the output for the test input.  The transformation seems to be a consistent, deterministic mapping of input colors to output colors.  There's no readily apparent mathematical formula governing the transformation beyond the mapping itself.

**examples summary**

The transformation applied to the input grids to produce the output grids in examples 1-4 is a consistent, deterministic mapping of input colors to output colors. This mapping is not based on a simple arithmetic operation, but rather a fixed, bijective function (one-to-one correspondence).  There is no obvious mathematical formula describing this mapping beyond the mapping itself.  The mapping can be represented as a lookup table or dictionary.

The following `color_map` dictionary summarizes the observed mappings:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    color_map = {
        1: 5,
        2: 6,
        3: 4,
        4: 3,
        5: 1,
        6: 2,
        8: 9,
        9: 8
    }

code_execution_result: 1

```

```

This dictionary can be used to transform any input grid by looking up each pixel's color in the `color_map` and replacing it with its corresponding value. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the grid remains unchanged; only the color values are transformed according to this fixed mapping.

**test**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]]


.. image:: _images/009-9.png

**observations**

Here's a report analyzing the test input and applying the derived transformation rule:

**Test Input:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   8: 3
    *   1: 3
    *   3: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors azure, blue, and green, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Predicted Output (based on color_map):**

Using the `color_map` dictionary developed from the examples, we can predict the output:

code_execution:
```python
color_map = {
    1: 5,
    2: 6,
    3: 4,
    4: 3,
    5: 1,
    6: 2,
    8: 9,
    9: 8
}

input_grid = [[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]
output_grid = [[color_map[pixel] for pixel in row] for row in input_grid]
print(output_grid)

```
code_execution_result:
```
[[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]
```

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   9: 3
    *   5: 3
    *   4: 3
*   objects: Three 1x1 objects of colors maroon, gray, and yellow, respectively, arranged horizontally and repeated vertically.

**Transformation:**

The transformation applied to the test input is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples. Each color in the input grid is mapped to its corresponding color in the `color_map` dictionary, resulting in the predicted output grid.


**Conclusion:**

The solution to this puzzle is a simple color mapping based on a lookup table. The `color_map` dictionary accurately predicts the output based on the examples and the test input. No other spatial or arithmetic operations were involved. The solution reflects a consistent and deterministic transformation across all examples provided.

**initialize the working output grid:**

function_call:

initialize_output_by_size

initialize_output_by_size(width=3, height=3, color=0)

The `initialize_output_by_size` function call has correctly created a 3x3 grid filled with zeros, which is appropriate given the size of the test input. The next step is to populate this grid using the `color_map` to apply the transformation derived from the examples.

To confirm the transformation and check the working output grid, I'll use the `color_map` to populate the grid:


code_execution:
```python
color_map = {
    1: 5,
    2: 6,
    3: 4,
    4: 3,
    5: 1,
    6: 2,
    8: 9,
    9: 8
}

input_grid = [[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]]
output_grid = [[color_map[pixel] for pixel in row] for row in input_grid]
print(output_grid)

```
code_execution_result:
```
[[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]
```

This confirms that the predicted output grid is `[[9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4], [9, 5, 4]]`.  This matches the analysis above.
