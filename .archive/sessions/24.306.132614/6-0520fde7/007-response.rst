Okay, I've initialized the 3x3 output grid with all white pixels (value 0).  My tentative predictions for the red pixel arrangements are:

**Option 1 (Cross Pattern):**

```
[[0, 2, 0],
 [2, 0, 2],
 [0, 2, 0]]
```

**Option 2 (Diagonal Pattern):**

```
[[0, 0, 0],
 [2, 0, 2],
 [0, 2, 0]]
```

I'll proceed cautiously, starting with Option 1 (Cross Pattern) and adding the red pixels one by one.  After each addition, I'll review the changes and the overall progress.  If Option 1 proves unsuccessful, I'll move on to Option 2.  Further code analysis might be needed after a few changes to further validate or invalidate my hypothesis.


**Next step: Add the red pixels based on Option 1, one by one.**
