Here's an analysis of example 3, followed by an updated hypothesis on the transformation:

**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0 (white): 13
    *   1 (blue): 6
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   objects: A vertical column of gray pixels in the center. Blue pixels are distributed around the edges.


**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0 (white): 7
    *   2 (red): 2
*   objects: Two red pixels, one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right corner.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: The output is a 3x3 grid; most cells' values are changed.
*   colors_changed: The primary color change is from blue and gray to red and white.


**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

Example 3 further refines our understanding of the transformation:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The output grid is consistently 3x3.

2.  **Color Change:** The central column of gray pixels in the input again seems inconsequential.  The transformation focuses on blue pixels.

3.  **Blue Pixel Count and Arrangement:** The number of blue pixels in the input *and their relative positions* influences the number and arrangement of red pixels in the output. The arrangement is not simply maximizing distance.

    *   Example 1: 4 blue pixels → 1 central red pixel.
    *   Example 2: 6 blue pixels → 4 red pixels in a cross.
    *   Example 3: 6 blue pixels → 2 red pixels diagonally opposed.

4.  **No Simple Function:** There's no readily apparent mathematical function to map the input blue pixel count to the output red pixel count and arrangement. The arrangement suggests a spatial component to the rule.

**Prediction and Next Steps:**

The key to unlocking this transformation lies in understanding how the arrangement of the blue pixels influences the red pixel arrangement in the 3x3 output. More examples are crucial, particularly those with varying numbers and arrangements of blue pixels. It's likely that the relative distance and adjacency between the blue pixels play a crucial role, rather than simply the total number of blue pixels.  We should experiment with examples containing clusters of blue pixels and isolated blue pixels to determine how grouping affects the output.
