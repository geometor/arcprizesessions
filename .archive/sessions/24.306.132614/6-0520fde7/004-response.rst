The transformation from input to output grids involves a reduction in size to a consistent 3x3 grid.  The central column of gray pixels (value 5) in the input appears to be irrelevant to the transformation.  The key driver is the number and arrangement of blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.

The output grid is primarily composed of white pixels (value 0), with red pixels (value 2) appearing based on a complex relationship with the input blue pixels.  There's no simple mathematical function mapping the number of blue pixels to the number of red pixels. The placement of red pixels is also spatially significant, seeming to depend on the relative positions of the blue pixels in the input.

Let's examine the patterns using Python code:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    example1_input = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                              [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                              [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    example1_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 2, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0]])
    
    example2_input = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                              [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                              [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]])
    
    example2_output = np.array([[0, 2, 0],
                               [0, 0, 2],
                               [0, 2, 0]])
    
    
    example3_input = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                              [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                              [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])
    
    example3_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                               [2, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 2]])
    
    print("Example 1:")
    print("Number of blue pixels:", np.sum(example1_input == 1))
    print("Example 2:")
    print("Number of blue pixels:", np.sum(example2_input == 1))
    print("Example 3:")
    print("Number of blue pixels:", np.sum(example3_input == 1))

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1:
Number of blue pixels: 7
Example 2:
Number of blue pixels: 10
Example 3:
Number of blue pixels: 9

```

The provided code counts all instances of '1' (blue) which is not quite right, and the output numbers don't seem to correlate directly with the number of red pixels in the outputs.


The relationship between blue pixel count in the input and red pixel count and arrangement in the output is not a simple function, and further investigation is needed.  We need more examples to discern the underlying pattern. The spatial distribution of the blue pixels is likely crucial. A more sophisticated analysis might involve analyzing adjacency matrices or using image processing techniques to detect clusters and patterns in the blue pixel distribution.  It might be useful to consider the distance between blue pixels and how that distance relates to the position of red pixels in the output.
