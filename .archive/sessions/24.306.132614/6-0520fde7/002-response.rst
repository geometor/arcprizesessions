Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a revised hypothesis on the transformation:

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0 (white): 13
    *   1 (blue): 6
    *   5 (gray): 3
*   objects: A vertical column of gray pixels in the center.  Blue pixels are more numerous and clustered than in example 1.


**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0 (white): 5
    *   2 (red): 4
*   objects: Four red pixels arranged in a cross pattern (+).


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed:  Similar size reduction as in Example 1.  All values except four are changed.
*   colors_changed: The output contains more red pixels and fewer white pixels than Example 1.


**Transformation Hypothesis Revision:**

Comparing Example 1 and Example 2 reveals a pattern:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The output grid is always 3x3.

2.  **Color Change:** The central column of gray pixels in the input seems irrelevant. The transformation focuses on blue pixels.

3.  **Blue Pixel Aggregation:** The number of blue pixels in the input appears to determine the number and arrangement of red pixels in the output.

    *   In Example 1, there are 4 blue pixels, resulting in 1 red pixel in the center of the output.
    *   In Example 2, there are 6 blue pixels, resulting in 4 red pixels arranged in a cross.  The arrangement might follow a pattern (e.g., maximizing distance between red pixels while staying in a 3x3 grid).

4.  **Implicit Rules:**  There appears to be an implicit rule mapping blue pixel counts to the number of red pixels and their arrangement. This is not a direct mapping - further examples are needed to elucidate the exact rule.

**Prediction and Next Steps:**

To test this hypothesis, I need more examples.  Specifically, examples with varying numbers of blue pixels would help to determine the function mapping input blue pixel count to output red pixel count and arrangement. Examples with blue pixels in different positions would confirm whether the position of blue pixels matters beyond its count.  Further, it is necessary to verify whether the gray column has any significance.  An example with a different number of gray pixels would help to answer this question.
