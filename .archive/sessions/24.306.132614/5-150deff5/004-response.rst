The transformation consistently involves a gray (5) object being replaced by two objects: a larger azure (8) object and a smaller red (2) object.  The azure (8) object maintains the overall shape and position of the original gray (5) object. The red (2) object's shape is related to, but smaller than, the original gray (5) object, and its precise position relative to the azure (8) object is somewhat variable. It is sometimes embedded within the azure (8) object, and other times adjacent to it.  There's no rigidly defined rule for the red (2) object's shape or position, suggesting a degree of flexibility or subjective interpretation in its placement.

Let's use code to investigate further:

    gray_indices = np.where(example1_input == 5)

    print("Red Indices:", red_indices)
    
    # Calculate overlap between gray and azure
    overlap = np.sum((example1_input == 5) & (example1_output == 8))
    print(f"Overlap between gray and azure: {overlap}")
    
    # Check if all gray pixels are replaced by azure or red
    all_gray_replaced = np.all((example1_input == 5) == ((example1_output == 8) | (example1_output == 2)))
    print(f"All gray pixels replaced by azure or red: {all_gray_replaced}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Gray Indices: (array([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]), array([2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7]))
Azure Indices: (array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]), array([2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7]))
Red Indices: (array([2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6]), array([4, 5, 6, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7]))
Overlap between gray and azure: 12
All gray pixels replaced by azure or red: True

```

The code confirms that all gray (5) pixels are replaced by either azure (8) or red (2) pixels in the output.  The overlap between the gray object and the resulting azure object is significant, highlighting the shape preservation.  The red pixels fill in the remaining space, forming a smaller, somewhat inverse or embedded shape related to the original gray (5) shape.  The analysis supports the summary of the transformation described earlier.  The variation in the red (2) object's exact placement across examples remains, suggesting some degree of flexibility or contextual interpretation within the transformation rule.
