**observations**
**test input:**

**input:**
  width: 11
  height: 8
  colors:
    - 0: (56)
    - 5: (20)
  objects:
    - A single connected gray (5) object with a somewhat irregular, roughly L-shaped form.


Let's use code to analyze the input and predict the output based on the patterns observed in the examples:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    gray_indices = np.where(test_input == 5)
    print("Gray Indices:", gray_indices)

code_execution_result: 1

```
Gray Indices: (array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5,
       6, 6]), array([2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6,
       5, 6]))

```

Based on the previous examples, we expect the gray (5) object to be replaced by a larger azure (8) object that maintains the original shape and location, and a smaller red (2) object whose shape is related to, but smaller than, the original gray (5) object. The red (2) object's position will likely be somewhat variable, possibly embedded within or adjacent to the azure (8) object.

Let's create a predicted output based on this transformation:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    test_output = np.zeros_like(test_input)
    
    # Roughly map the gray object to azure
    test_output[gray_indices] = 8
    
    
    # Add red pixels based on the shape of the original gray object. Since the placement is flexible, this is an approximation
    
    test_output[0,6] = 2
    test_output[1,6] = 2
    test_output[2,1] = 2
    test_output[2,0] = 2
    test_output[3,4] = 2
    test_output[4,3] = 2
    test_output[5,5] = 2
    test_output[6,5] = 2
    
    
    
    print(test_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 8 8 0 8 2 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 8 8 0 0 2 0 0 0 0]
 [2 2 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 2 8 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

This predicted output is a reasonable approximation given the observed patterns in the examples. The azure (8) pixels largely follow the original gray (5) shape, and the red (2) pixels are placed in a way that is somewhat related to but smaller than the original gray shape.  The exact placement of the red pixels is an approximation because of the flexibility noted in the previous examples.  To improve this prediction, a more sophisticated algorithm that better captures the irregular placement of the red pixels might be needed, potentially considering distance to the azure pixels, area occupied, or shape similarity to the input gray object.  But this is a good starting point for a solution.
