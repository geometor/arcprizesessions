**example_3**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 8
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 5: (12)
  objects:
    - A single connected gray (5) object.

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 8
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 2: (6)
    - 8: (12)
  objects:
    - A single connected azure (8) object.  The shape and position are similar to the gray (5) object in the input.
    - A single connected red (2) object. The shape is smaller than the azure (8) object, and positioned to the upper left of the azure (8) object.  It seems to represent a portion of the original gray object.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 18
  colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The azure (8) pixels largely follow the shape of the original gray (5) object. The red (2) pixels form a smaller shape adjacent to the azure (8) object.


**transformation:**
  - The gray (5) object is transformed into two objects: azure (8) and red (2). The azure (8) object largely retains the shape and position of the input gray (5) object. The red (2) object forms a smaller, adjacent shape seemingly related to the original gray object's shape.


**Overall Summary of Transformations (across all examples):**

The core transformation involves replacing a gray (5) object with two objects: a larger azure (8) object and a smaller red (2) object. The azure (8) object closely follows the shape and location of the original gray (5) object. The red (2) object's shape is related to but smaller than the original gray (5) object, and its position relative to the azure (8) object varies slightly across examples (sometimes embedded within the azure object, sometimes adjacent to it). There's no consistent strict rule governing the exact shape or position of the red (2) object, suggesting flexibility or a somewhat subjective interpretation within the overall transformation. The key consistent element remains the preservation of the original gray (5) object's overall shape and location by the azure (8) object.
