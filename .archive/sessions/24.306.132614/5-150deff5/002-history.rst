**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 11
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (72)
    - 5: (16)
  objects:
    - A single connected gray (5) object, roughly resembling an irregular blob.

**output:**
  width: 11
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (72)
    - 2: (7)
    - 8: (16)
  objects:
    - A single connected azure (8) object. The shape and position are the same as the gray object in the input.
    - A single connected red (2) object. The shape is similar to the gray (5) object, but smaller and positioned to the lower-right of the azure (8) object.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 23
  colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The azure pixels trace the original gray shape. The red pixels form a smaller, offset shape within the azure object.

**transformation:**
  - The gray (5) object is transformed into two objects: a larger azure (8) object maintaining the shape and location of the input gray (5) object; and a smaller red (2) object occupying a portion of the space occupied by the original gray (5) object.  The position and size relationships between the new objects are not strictly defined.
  - It appears that the transformation involves a color change and a minor shape alteration. The original shape is preserved mostly in the azure (8) component.  The position and size relationships of the new shapes suggest that the output might be a stylized depiction of the input object.
