====

The `initialize_output_by_size` function call correctly created an 11x8 grid filled with zeros, which is a blank canvas to build the output upon.  This is appropriate because the output grid's structure is not directly copied from the input grid.  We're creating a new grid based on the transformation rules extracted from the examples.


The next step is to progressively fill this grid using `set_pixel` or `set_range` based on the predicted output generated earlier.  Because the placement of the red (2) pixels is flexible, some trial and error might be necessary to match the pattern observed in the examples.
