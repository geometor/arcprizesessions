**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 11
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (72)
    - 5: (16)
  objects:
    - A single connected gray (5) object, roughly resembling an irregular blob.

**output:**
  width: 11
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (72)
    - 2: (7)
    - 8: (16)
  objects:
    - A single connected azure (8) object. The shape and position are the same as the gray object in the input.
    - A single connected red (2) object. The shape is similar to the gray (5) object, but smaller and positioned to the lower-right of the azure (8) object.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 23
  colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The azure pixels trace the original gray shape. The red pixels form a smaller, offset shape within the azure object.

**transformation:**
  - The gray (5) object is transformed into two objects: a larger azure (8) object maintaining the shape and location of the input gray (5) object; and a smaller red (2) object occupying a portion of the space occupied by the original gray (5) object.  The position and size relationships between the new objects are not strictly defined.
  - It appears that the transformation involves a color change and a minor shape alteration. The original shape is preserved mostly in the azure (8) component.  The position and size relationships of the new shapes suggest that the output might be a stylized depiction of the input object.

**example_2**

**input:**
  width: 10
  height: 8
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 5: (16)
  objects:
    - A single connected gray (5) object, roughly resembling an irregular blob.

**output:**
  width: 10
  height: 8
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 2: (7)
    - 8: (16)
  objects:
    - A single connected azure (8) object. The shape and position are mostly the same as the gray object in the input.
    - A single connected red (2) object. The shape is similar to the gray (5) object, but smaller and positioned to the lower-right of the azure (8) object.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 23
  colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The azure pixels largely overlap the original gray shape. The red pixels form a shape embedded within the azure object, resembling an inverted version of a part of the original gray shape.

**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, the gray (5) object is transformed into two objects: azure (8) and red (2). The azure (8) object largely retains the shape and position of the original gray (5) object.  The red (2) object appears to be a slightly smaller, inverted, and embedded shape.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples show a transformation where a single connected gray (5) object is transformed into two connected objects: a larger azure (8) object that largely preserves the original shape and position, and a smaller red (2) object, whose shape is related to the original gray (5) object but is somewhat altered, typically smaller and positioned within or near the azure (8) object.  The exact relationship in shape and position between the red (2) and azure (8) objects is not strictly consistent, suggesting a slightly flexible rule.  The key consistent element is the preservation of the original object's general shape and position by the azure (8) pixels, with the addition of the red (2) pixels forming a related but smaller, somewhat inverse or embedded shape.
