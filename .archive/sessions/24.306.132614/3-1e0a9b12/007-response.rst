The `initialize_output_by_size` function call correctly created a 5x5 grid filled with zeros (white). This is consistent with the observation that the output grids in the training examples always had all cells set to 0 except for the relocated colored objects.  This is a good starting point.

Let's proceed with setting pixels in the bottom rows, trying to maintain vertical adjacency where possible.  I will use `set_pixel` and `set_range` as needed, reviewing the grid after each change.
