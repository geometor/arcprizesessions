Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**input:**
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (8)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (0,1), (2,1)
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - pink (6): (2,2)
    - maroon (9): (0,3)

**output:**
  width: 4
  height: 4
  colors:
    - 0: (12)
    - 1: (1)
    - 4: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - blue (1): (3,0)
    - yellow (4): (2,1), (3,1)
    - pink (6): (3,2)
    - maroon (9): (3,3)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects in the input grid have been moved to the bottom right corner of the output grid.  The rest of the cells are changed to white (0).


**transformation:**
  - The non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid, maintaining their relative positions to each other.
  - All other cells become white (0).

This transformation suggests a process of extracting specific colored objects and placing them in a designated area while clearing the rest of the grid.  The relative positions of the objects are preserved.
