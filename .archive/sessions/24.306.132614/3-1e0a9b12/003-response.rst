**example_3 observations**

**input:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: (17)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (1)
    - 3: (3)
    - 6: (1)
  objects:
    - blue (1): (0,3), (2,3)
    - red (2): (2,4)
    - green (3): (1,1), (2,1), (4,1)
    - pink (6): (3,0)

**output:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: (20)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (1)
    - 3: (3)
    - 6: (1)
  objects:
    - pink (6): (4,0)
    - green (3): (4,1), (2,2)
    - blue (1): (4,3), (4,4)
    - red (2): (4,4)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects are moved towards the bottom-right corner, but unlike the previous examples, they don't necessarily stay together. Some objects are moved individually to the bottom row. There seems to be no strict order or arrangement.

**transformation:**
  - Non-zero colored objects are moved towards the bottom rows, not necessarily to the bottom-right corner.  Some objects are moved individually, some grouped.
  - The movement prioritizes placing elements at the bottom of the grid, seemingly without specific grouping or ordering within that bottom area.  Vertical alignment is not strictly maintained.
  - All other cells are set to white (0).

**Summary of Transformations Across Examples:**

The transformation across all three examples involves moving non-zero colored objects to the bottom of the grid, filling the grid from left to right, then top to bottom within each row.  However, the strategy for grouping and arranging these objects differs:

* **Example 1:** Individual objects are moved to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions to one another.
* **Example 2:** Vertically adjacent objects are grouped and moved, preserving vertical adjacency.
* **Example 3:** Objects are moved to the bottom rows with less emphasis on grouping or maintaining specific relative positions.  It's a more independent movement of individual objects to the bottom rows.

The core principle remains consistent: move colored objects to the bottom, but the implementation strategy adapts based on the spatial arrangement of the objects in the input.  There's no single, rigidly defined algorithm; rather, a flexible approach that prioritizes moving to the bottom while respecting existing vertical adjacency where feasible.
