**example_2 observations**

**input:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: (28)
    - 4: (3)
    - 7: (2)
    - 8: (2)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)
    - azure (8): (1,3), (4,3)
    - maroon (9): (0,5)

**output:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: (30)
    - 4: (3)
    - 7: (2)
    - 8: (2)
    - 9: (1)
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (5,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,4), (5,4)
    - azure (8): (4,3), (5,3)
    - maroon (9): (5,5)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 6
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored objects in the input grid have been moved to the bottom right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions, similar to example 1. However, some objects are now placed across multiple rows.


**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, non-zero colored objects are moved to the bottom-right corner, maintaining their relative positions.
  - The key difference here is that instead of placing objects one by one, groups that are vertically aligned seem to be placed together to retain their vertical arrangement.
  - All other cells are set to white (0).

Considering both examples, the transformation appears to be a consolidation of colored objects to the bottom-right corner while preserving their relative spatial relationships.  The difference between examples 1 and 2 lies in how the objects are grouped and arranged in the output — individual objects in example 1 and vertically adjacent groups in example 2.  The algorithm may prioritize maintaining vertical adjacency where possible.
