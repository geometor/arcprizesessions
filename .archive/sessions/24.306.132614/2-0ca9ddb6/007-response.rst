The working output grid is currently identical to the test input grid. This is correct, as `initialize_output_from_input` simply copies the input.  The transformation will be applied by setting pixels in the subsequent steps.

The code execution in the previous step confirms that the pattern of adding yellow and orange pixels around red and blue pixels forms a consistent 2x2 pattern where possible given the boundary conditions of the grid.

Next steps should involve setting pixels in the output grid based on the transformation rule to add yellow around red pixels and orange around blue pixels.  We'll need to check for boundary conditions to ensure the 2x2 pattern is applied correctly without going out of bounds.
