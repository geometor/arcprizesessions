**example_3**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (73)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 6: (1)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (2,2)
    - single blue pixel at (7,3)
    - single magenta pixel at (5,6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 6: (1)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (2,2)
    - single blue pixel at (7,3)
    - single magenta pixel at (5,6)
    - four yellow pixels around red pixel
    - four orange pixels around blue pixel


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels

**transformation:**
- The transformation is consistent with examples 1 and 2.  Yellow pixels are added in a 2x2 square around the red pixel. Orange pixels are added in a 2x2 square around the blue pixel. The magenta pixel remains unchanged.  The transformation rule seems to only apply to red and blue pixels.


**Ruminate Phase**

Based on the three examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with value 2 (red).
2. **Add Yellow Surround:** Add a 2x2 square of yellow pixels (value 4) centered around each red pixel.  If a red pixel is at the edge, the yellow square will be partially outside the grid boundaries, those pixels remain unchanged.
3. **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels with value 1 (blue).
4. **Add Orange Surround:** Add a 2x2 square of orange pixels (value 7) centered around each blue pixel. If a blue pixel is at the edge, the orange square will be partially outside the grid boundaries, those pixels remain unchanged.

This rule consistently explains the changes from input to output in all three examples.  No other pixels are affected.
