**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (73)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (6, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3,2)
    - single blue pixel at (6,6)
    - yellow pixels at (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)
    - orange pixels at (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels

**transformation:**
- The transformation appears to add yellow and orange pixels around the existing red and blue pixels. The pattern suggests a 2x2 block of yellow pixels centered around the red pixel and a 2x2 block of orange pixels around the blue pixel.  The added pixels are symmetrical with respect to the original single pixels.

**input:**

  colors:
    - 0: (68)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (2)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single azure pixel at (0,3)
    - two red pixels at (3,0), (7,0)
    - two blue pixels at (3,2), (6,6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (56)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (2)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (8)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single azure pixel at (0,3)
    - two red pixels at (3,0), (7,0)
    - two blue pixels at (3,2), (6,6)
    - yellow pixels at (1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,7), (7,0), (7,2), (8,1), (8,3)
    - orange pixels at (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (2,5), (2,7), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 16
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels around existing pixels.

**transformation:**
- Similar to example 1, this transformation adds yellow and orange pixels around the existing pixels. The pattern is more complex and less easily described than in example 1.  There's no simple 2x2 block pattern here.  The placement of yellows and oranges seems to depend on the position and type of existing pixels. There is a spatial relationship between existing pixels and the added yellow and orange pixels.  The transformation is not merely adding fixed-size blocks around each colored pixel, it appears more complex and potentially influenced by neighboring pixels as well.  Further examples will help refine the understanding of this transformation rule.
