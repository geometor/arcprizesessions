    - orange pixels at (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels

**transformation:**
- The transformation appears to add yellow and orange pixels around the existing red and blue pixels. The pattern suggests a 2x2 block of yellow pixels centered around the red pixel and a 2x2 block of orange pixels around the blue pixel.  The added pixels are symmetrical with respect to the original single pixels.

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 16
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels around existing pixels.

**transformation:**
- Similar to example 1, this transformation adds yellow and orange pixels around the existing pixels. The pattern is more complex and less easily described than in example 1.  There's no simple 2x2 block pattern here.  The placement of yellows and oranges seems to depend on the position and type of existing pixels. There is a spatial relationship between existing pixels and the added yellow and orange pixels.  The transformation is not merely adding fixed-size blocks around each colored pixel, it appears more complex and potentially influenced by neighboring pixels as well.  Further examples will help refine the understanding of this transformation rule.

    - single blue pixel at (7,3)
    - single magenta pixel at (5,6)
    - four yellow pixels around red pixel
    - four orange pixels around blue pixel


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels

**transformation:**
- The transformation is consistent with examples 1 and 2.  Yellow pixels are added in a 2x2 square around the red pixel. Orange pixels are added in a 2x2 square around the blue pixel. The magenta pixel remains unchanged.  The transformation rule seems to only apply to red and blue pixels.


**Ruminate Phase**

Based on the three examples, the transformation rule appears to be:

1. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with value 2 (red).
2. **Add Yellow Surround:** Add a 2x2 square of yellow pixels (value 4) centered around each red pixel.  If a red pixel is at the edge, the yellow square will be partially outside the grid boundaries, those pixels remain unchanged.
3. **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels with value 1 (blue).
4. **Add Orange Surround:** Add a 2x2 square of orange pixels (value 7) centered around each blue pixel. If a blue pixel is at the edge, the orange square will be partially outside the grid boundaries, those pixels remain unchanged.

This rule consistently explains the changes from input to output in all three examples.  No other pixels are affected.

**examples summary**

The transformation consistently adds yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around red (2) and blue (1) pixels respectively.  The pattern is a 2x2 square of the new color centered on the original colored pixel.  If the original colored pixel is at or near the edge of the grid, the 2x2 square may extend beyond the grid boundaries; these out-of-bounds pixels remain unchanged.  No other pixels are affected by the transformation.  The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged in all three examples.

The code confirms the pattern observed.  The difference array shows the added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels precisely surrounding the original red (2) and blue (1) pixels, respectively.  A 2x2 pattern centered around the original colored pixels.  The pattern is consistent across all three examples.

  - single blue pixel at (2,6)
  - single magenta pixel at (7,1)
  - single azure pixel at (5,5)
  - single red pixel at (7,7)

Applying the transformation rule:

1. **Red Pixels:** There are red pixels at (3,2) and (7,7).
2. **Yellow Surround:** A 2x2 yellow square will be centered around (3,2) and (7,7). Because (7,7) is in the corner, only three additional yellows will be added.
3. **Blue Pixels:** There is a blue pixel at (2,6).
4. **Orange Surround:** A 2x2 orange square will be centered around (2,6). Because (2,6) is near the edge, only three additional oranges will be added.

The magenta and azure pixels will remain unchanged.

The predicted output is shown above.  The code accurately reflects the application of the transformation rule derived from the examples.  The added yellow and orange pixels precisely surround the red and blue pixels, respectively, forming 2x2 squares where possible, constrained by the grid boundaries.

The working output grid is currently identical to the test input grid. This is correct, as `initialize_output_from_input` simply copies the input.  The transformation will be applied by setting pixels in the subsequent steps.

The code execution in the previous step confirms that the pattern of adding yellow and orange pixels around red and blue pixels forms a consistent 2x2 pattern where possible given the boundary conditions of the grid.

Next steps should involve setting pixels in the output grid based on the transformation rule to add yellow around red pixels and orange around blue pixels.  We'll need to check for boundary conditions to ensure the 2x2 pattern is applied correctly without going out of bounds.

The change is consistent with the rule.  A yellow (4) pixel has been added at (1,1), which is part of the 2x2 square centered around the red pixel at (3,2).

Let's verify this using code execution.  The code below checks the current state of the working grid and ensures that only the expected changes have been made.

The difference array shows that only the expected pixel (1,1) has been changed to yellow (4).  All other pixels remain unchanged.  The transformation is proceeding as expected.

The change is consistent with the transformation rule. A yellow (4) pixel has been added at (3,1), which is another part of the 2x2 square centered around the red pixel at (3,2).

Let's verify this using code execution. The code below checks the current state of the working grid and ensures that only the expected changes have been made.

```

The difference array shows that only the expected pixel (3,1) has been changed to yellow (4). All other pixels remain unchanged. The transformation is proceeding as expected.  We need to continue adding yellow pixels around the red pixel at (3,2) and orange pixels around the blue pixel at (2,6), and the red pixel at (7,7).  Remember to account for boundary conditions.  The next steps will involve setting pixels (1,3), (3,3), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (7,6), (7,8).

**update working grid**

<instructions>

- use function_call to set pixels on the grid to achieve the solution

- set_pixel: update one pixel at a time
  - set_range: update a rectangular subset of pixel
- when you think you have completed the output, call the submit function
