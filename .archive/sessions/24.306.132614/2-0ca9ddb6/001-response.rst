**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (73)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3, 2)
    - single blue pixel at (6, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (64)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red pixel at (3,2)
    - single blue pixel at (6,6)
    - yellow pixels at (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)
    - orange pixels at (5,6), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: added yellow and orange pixels

**transformation:**
- The transformation appears to add yellow and orange pixels around the existing red and blue pixels. The pattern suggests a 2x2 block of yellow pixels centered around the red pixel and a 2x2 block of orange pixels around the blue pixel.  The added pixels are symmetrical with respect to the original single pixels.
