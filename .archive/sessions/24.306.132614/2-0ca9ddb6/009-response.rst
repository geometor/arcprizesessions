The change is consistent with the rule.  A yellow (4) pixel has been added at (1,1), which is part of the 2x2 square centered around the red pixel at (3,2).

Let's verify this using code execution.  The code below checks the current state of the working grid and ensures that only the expected changes have been made.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    working_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    diff = working_grid - test_input
    print(f'{diff=}')

code_execution_result: 1

```
diff=array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

```

The difference array shows that only the expected pixel (1,1) has been changed to yellow (4).  All other pixels remain unchanged.  The transformation is proceeding as expected.
