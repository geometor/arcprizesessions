**observations**
**test input:**

width: 9
height: 9
colors:
  - 0: (73)
  - 1: (1)
  - 2: (2)
  - 6: (1)
  - 8: (1)
objects:
  - single red pixel at (3,2)
  - single blue pixel at (2,6)
  - single magenta pixel at (7,1)
  - single azure pixel at (5,5)
  - single red pixel at (7,7)

Applying the transformation rule:

1. **Red Pixels:** There are red pixels at (3,2) and (7,7).
2. **Yellow Surround:** A 2x2 yellow square will be centered around (3,2) and (7,7). Because (7,7) is in the corner, only three additional yellows will be added.
3. **Blue Pixels:** There is a blue pixel at (2,6).
4. **Orange Surround:** A 2x2 orange square will be centered around (2,6). Because (2,6) is near the edge, only three additional oranges will be added.

The magenta and azure pixels will remain unchanged.

**predicted output:**

    test_output[3, 5] = 7
    test_output[1, 1] = 4
    test_output[1, 3] = 4
    test_output[3, 1] = 4
    test_output[3, 3] = 4
    test_output[7, 6] = 7
    test_output[7, 8] = 7

The predicted output is shown above.  The code accurately reflects the application of the transformation rule derived from the examples.  The added yellow and orange pixels precisely surround the red and blue pixels, respectively, forming 2x2 squares where possible, constrained by the grid boundaries.
