To proceed, I need a clear definition of this function and its expected behavior in the context of transforming the grid.  Specifically, I need to know:\n\n1.  **What does `set_range` do?**  Does it modify a range of cells in the grid? If so, which cells and how? Does it replace cells with specific colors or values?\n2.  **What are the parameters?**  What do `1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 2` represent?  Are they coordinates, ranges, colors, or something else?\n\n\nOnce I have this information, I can execute the code and proceed to evaluate and update the working output grid according to the rule observed from previous examples.  Without this clarification, I cannot complete this step.\n"
