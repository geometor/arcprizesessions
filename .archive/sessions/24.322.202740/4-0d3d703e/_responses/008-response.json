            "text": "The `transform_grid` function correctly maps the colors from the input grid based on the mapping derived from the examples. The resulting output grid, [[9 5 4]\n [9 5 4]\n [9 5 4]],  reflects this mapping. The code execution confirms this.  The current approach relies on a hardcoded mapping, which limits its generalizability.  A more robust solution would require identifying the underlying rule that governs the color mappings across different examples.  This would likely involve understanding the relationship between the input color values and their corresponding output color values, potentially uncovering a mathematical or logical rule.  However, given the available data, the color mapping approach is the most accurate and reliable strategy for predicting the output of new input grids.  To improve this, more examples are needed to potentially determine the pattern in the color mappings across the different examples.\n"
