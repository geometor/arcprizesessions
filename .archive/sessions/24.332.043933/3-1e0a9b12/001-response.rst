The input grid is a 4x4 grid with four colored pixels (yellow, maroon, yellow, and blue) and the remaining pixels are white (0). The output grid also has dimension 4x4, and appears to have moved the colored pixels from their scattered positions in the input to the bottom row, while maintaining their left-to-right order of appearance: yellow(4), maroon(9), yellow(4), then blue(1), to the bottom row - but in the order: blue(1), yellow(4), magenta(6), maroon(9). Note that magenta appeared in the input, but I missed it in my first pass description - so it would appear the rule is to take the colored pixels in row-scan order and move them to the bottom row from left to right

The code execution confirms my observations. The colored pixels from the input are moved to the last row in the output. Specifically, we see there are 5 colored pixels in the input. In the output, the number of colored pixels and their values are preserved, but the positions have changed. The input colored positions are (0,1), (0,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), while the output colored positions are (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The colored pixels are reordered by row scan order and placed left to right along the bottom row. The two yellow pixels in the input, at (0,1) and (2,1), are mapped to (2,1) and (3,1) respectively in the output. Note that (2,1) in the output is preserving one of the yellow pixels in the input, so only those not already on the bottom row are moved

   differences:
     cells_changed: 6
     colors_changed: False
     transformation:
       - move colored pixels to bottom row
       - preserve order of colored pixels from top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan order and fill in the bottom row from left-to-right. If the colored pixel was already in the correct location, maintain it.

Transformation Story:

Identify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Extract them in row-scan order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Create an output grid of the same dimensions, filled with white pixels (0). Iterate through the extracted pixels and their original positions. If a colored pixel is on the bottom row of the input, preserve its position and value in the output. Then, iterate through the remaining colored pixels in the extracted order and place them on the bottom row of the output grid from left to right, into any remaining empty spots, maintaining their original color value.
