            "text": "The input grid is 5x5, with colored pixels: blue(1), green(3), blue(1), red(2), magenta(6), green(3). The output grid is also 5x5. It looks like the colored pixels are being moved to the bottom row, maintaining their original left-to-right, top-to-bottom order of appearance, but preserving those that were on the bottom row to begin with. We see that the green at (2,1), blue at (2,3) and red at (2,4) on the bottom row have their locations preserved. The others are moved from top-to-bottom, and left-to-right into the remaining empty slots on the bottom row in that order.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ninput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 3, 0, 1, 2],\n [6, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]])\n\noutput_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 3, 0, 1, 0],\n [6, 3, 0, 1, 2]])\n\ndef analyze_grid(grid):\n  colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n  color_counts = dict(zip(colors, counts))\n  height, width = grid.shape\n  colored_positions = []\n  for r in range(height):\n      for c in range(width):\n          if grid[r,c] != 0:\n              colored_positions.append((grid[r,c], (r,c)))\n\n  return height, width, color_counts, colored_positions\n\ninput_height, input_width, input_color_counts, input_colored_positions = analyze_grid(input_grid)\noutput_height, output_width, output_color_counts, output_colored_positions = analyze_grid(output_grid)\n\nprint(f\"Input Grid Analysis:\")\nprint(f\"  Height: {input_height}\")\nprint(f\"  Width: {input_width}\")\nprint(f\"  Color Counts: {input_color_counts}\")\nprint(f\"  Colored Positions: {input_colored_positions}\")\n\nprint(f\"Output Grid Analysis:\")\nprint(f\"  Height: {output_height}\")\nprint(f\"  Width: {output_width}\")\nprint(f\"  Color Counts: {output_color_counts}\")\nprint(f\"  Colored Positions: {output_colored_positions}\")\n\ndiff_cells = np.sum(input_grid != output_grid)\nprint(f\"Number of cells changed: {diff_cells}\")\nprint(f\"Colors changed: {set(input_color_counts.keys()) == set(output_color_counts.keys())}\")\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nInput Grid Analysis:\n  Height: 5\n  Width: 5\n  Color Counts: {np.int64(0): np.int64(19), np.int64(1): np.int64(2), np.int64(2): np.int64(1), np.int64(3): np.int64(3), np.int64(6): np.int64(1)}\n  Colored Positions: [(np.int64(1), (0, 3)), (np.int64(3), (1, 1)), (np.int64(3), (2, 1)), (np.int64(1), (2, 3)), (np.int64(2), (2, 4)), (np.int64(6), (3, 0)), (np.int64(3), (4, 1))]\nOutput Grid Analysis:\n  Height: 5\n  Width: 5\n  Color Counts: {np.int64(0): np.int64(19), np.int64(1): np.int64(2), np.int64(2): np.int64(1), np.int64(3): np.int64(3), np.int64(6): np.int64(1)}\n  Colored Positions: [(np.int64(3), (2, 1)), (np.int64(1), (3, 3)), (np.int64(3), (4, 1)), (np.int64(1), (4, 3)), (np.int64(2), (4, 4)), (np.int64(6), (4, 0))]\nNumber of cells changed: 6\nColors changed: True\n\n```\nThe code execution confirms that the number and type of colors are preserved. It shows that the number of cells changed is 6. Colored pixels in the input are moved to the bottom row, while preserving any pixels already on the bottom row. All pixels that were not on the bottom row are moved to the bottom row while maintaining their scan-order appearance - placed in remaining empty spots from left-to-right.\n\n```yaml\ninput:\n  width: 5\n  height: 5\n  colors:\n    0: 19\n    1: 2\n    2: 1\n    3: 3\n    6: 1\n  objects:\n    - single pixel of color 1 at position (0,3)\n    - single pixel of color 3 at position (1,1)\n    - single pixel of color 3 at position (2,1)\n    - single pixel of color 1 at position (2,3)\n    - single pixel of color 2 at position (2,4)\n    - single pixel of color 6 at position (3,0)\n    - single pixel of color 3 at position (4,1)\n```\n\n```yaml\noutput:\n  width: 5\n  height: 5\n  colors:\n    0: 19\n    1: 2\n    2: 1\n    3: 3\n    6: 1\n  objects:\n    - single pixel of color 3 at position (2,1)\n    - single pixel of color 3 at position (3,1)\n    - single pixel of color 1 at position (3,3)\n    - single pixel of color 6 at position (4,0)\n    - single pixel of color 3 at position (4,1)\n    - single pixel of color 1 at position (4,3)\n    - single pixel of color 2 at position (4,4)\n```\n\n```yaml\ndifferences:\n  cells_changed: 6\n  colors_changed: False\n  transformation:\n    - move all colored pixels to the bottom row\n    - if a colored pixel is already on the bottom row, keep it in place\n    - maintain the left-to-right, top-to-bottom order when placing pixels on the bottom row, filling empty slots in that order\n```\n\nTransformation Story:\n\nIdentify all non-white pixels in the input grid. Extract them in row-scan order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right). Create an output grid of the same dimensions, filled with white pixels (0). Iterate through the extracted pixels and their original positions. If a colored pixel is on the bottom row of the input, preserve its position and value in the output. Then, iterate through the remaining colored pixels in the extracted order and place them on the bottom row of the output grid from left to right, into any remaining empty spots, maintaining their original color value.\n"
