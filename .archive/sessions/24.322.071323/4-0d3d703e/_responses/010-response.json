            "text": "**Review of `set_range` Operation:**\n\nThe `set_range` function call `set_range(0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 9)` sets a rectangular region of the working grid to the value 9 (maroon).  The coordinates suggest that a 3x1 rectangle starting at (0,0) has been filled. This corresponds to the first column of the working grid. This is consistent with the observation that the color in the first column of the input (azure, 8) maps to maroon (9) in the example grids.\n\n\n**Code Execution (Investigating Working Grid Properties):**\n\nThe following code examines the current state of the working grid:\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[9, 0, 0],\n                        [9, 0, 0],\n                        [9, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Grid:\\n\", working_grid)\nprint(\"\\nShape:\", working_grid.shape)\nprint(\"\\nUnique Values:\", np.unique(working_grid))\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Grid:\n [[9 0 0]\n [9 0 0]\n [9 0 0]]\n\nShape: (3, 3)\n\nUnique Values: [0 9]\n\n```\nThe code shows that the working grid now contains two unique values: 0 (white) and 9 (maroon). The first column is correctly filled with 9, representing the mapping from azure (8) in the input to maroon (9) based on example 4.\n\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nThe next step is to fill the remaining columns of the working grid based on the color mapping derived from the examples. I will need to adapt the `transform_grid` function to accurately handle potential differences in the order of unique colors before proceeding.  A manual determination of the mapping based on comparing input colors with example mappings is currently the more reliable approach.\n\nBased on example 4, the mapping seems to be 8 -> 9, 1 -> 4, 3 -> 6. So the next step would be to fill the rest of the columns based on this observation.\n\n**update working grid**\nfunction_call:\nset_range\n\nresult:\nset_range(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4)\n**working output grid**\nupdated with your changes\n\n[[9 4 0]\n [9 4 0]\n [9 4 0]]\n\n\n\n<start_of_image>heatmap:\n```\n[[9 4 0]\n [9 4 0]\n [9 4 0]]\n```\n\nThe second column has now been correctly updated using `set_range` function based on the example 4 mapping.\n\n**Code Execution (Investigating Working Grid Properties):**\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[9, 4, 0],\n                        [9, 4, 0],\n                        [9, 4, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Grid:\\n\", working_grid)\nprint(\"\\nShape:\", working_grid.shape)\nprint(\"\\nUnique Values:\", np.unique(working_grid))\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Grid:\n [[9 4 0]\n [9 4 0]\n [9 4 0]]\n\nShape: (3, 3)\n\nUnique Values: [0 4 9]\n\n```\nThe code shows that the working grid now contains three unique values: 0 (white), 4 (yellow), and 9 (maroon).  The first two columns are now correctly filled based on the mapping from the examples.\n\n**update working grid**\nfunction_call:\nset_range\n\nresult:\nset_range(0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 6)\n**working output grid**\nupdated with your changes\n\n[[9 4 6]\n [9 4 6]\n [9 4 6]]\n\n\n\nheatmap:\n```\n[[9 4 6]\n [9 4 6]\n [9 4 6]]\n```\n\nThe final column has been updated, completing the grid.\n\n**Code Execution (Investigating Working Grid Properties):**\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[9, 4, 6],\n                        [9, 4, 6],\n                        [9, 4, 6]])\n\nprint(\"Working Grid:\\n\", working_grid)\nprint(\"\\nShape:\", working_grid.shape)\nprint(\"\\nUnique Values:\", np.unique(working_grid))\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Grid:\n [[9 4 6]\n [9 4 6]\n [9 4 6]]\n\nShape: (3, 3)\n\nUnique Values: [4 6 9]\n\n```\nThe code shows that the working grid now contains three unique values: 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta), and 9 (maroon). The grid is complete and correctly reflects the predicted color mapping.\n\nfunction_call:\nsubmit\n\nresult:\nThe puzzle has been submitted.  Awaiting evaluation.\n\n"
