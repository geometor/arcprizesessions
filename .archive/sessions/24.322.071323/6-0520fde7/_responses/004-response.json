This involves a significant reduction in size and a loss of information. The central column of gray pixels is consistently removed in this process.\n\n2. **Color Replacement:** Blue pixels (1) are generally replaced with white pixels (0) in the downscaled grid.\n\n3. **Red Pixel Placement:**  The number and position of the red pixels (2) in the output grid appear to be determined by the distribution of blue pixels in the original input grid.  The exact rule is still unclear, but it's not a simple one-to-one mapping.  It seems the distribution of the blue pixels determines how many red pixels are placed in the 3x3 output and where they are positioned.\n\n4. **Remaining Pixels:**  The remaining pixels in the 3x3 output are white (0).\n\n\n**Code Investigation to Further Explore Patterns:**\n\nThe following code analyzes the examples to find potential correlations between the input blue pixel distribution and the output red pixel positions.  It's a preliminary investigation, and more sophisticated analysis may be needed to fully uncover the rule.\n\n"

A more detailed analysis of the *positions* of blue pixels in the input relative to the positions of the red pixels in the output is needed to fully determine the transformation rule.  Simple counting isn't sufficient.  More sophisticated image processing or pattern recognition techniques might be necessary to definitively determine the rule.  For example, one could try to analyze the centroids or moments of the blue pixel distributions to see if those correlate to the red pixel positions.\n\n\n**Proposed Natural Language Program (Incomplete):**\n\nThe transformation involves downscaling the 3x7 input grid to a 3x3 grid, removing the central column. Blue pixels are replaced with white. The placement of red pixels in the output is determined by a (currently unknown) function of the distribution of the blue pixels in the input.  This function needs further investigation using more advanced techniques than simple counting.  A potential approach involves calculating features (like moments) of the blue pixel distribution and using those to predict the red pixel positions.  A machine learning model trained on more examples might be effective.\n"
