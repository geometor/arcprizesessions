            "text": "Based on the provided examples, the transformation involves replacing gray (5) pixels with a combination of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels while maintaining the overall shape of the gray object. The specific arrangement of blue and red pixels appears context-dependent and doesn't follow a simple, easily programmable pattern like strict alternation or mirroring.  Instead, the replacement seems influenced by the shape and symmetry of the gray object in each input.\n\n\nTo analyze the test input, let's first represent it as a NumPy array and then investigate its properties.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ntest_input = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\nprint(\"Test Input Shape:\", test_input.shape)\nprint(\"Number of Gray Pixels:\", np.count_nonzero(test_input == 5))\ngray_indices = np.where(test_input == 5)\nprint(\"Indices of Gray Pixels:\", gray_indices)\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nTest Input Shape: (8, 11)\nNumber of Gray Pixels: 26\nIndices of Gray Pixels: (array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]), array([2, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6]))\n```\n\nThe test input has 26 gray pixels arranged in a somewhat irregular shape.  The shape is reminiscent of the shapes in the training examples but more complex.  Based on the previous examples, I predict that these 26 gray pixels will be replaced with 26 pixels of light blue (8) and red (2), maintaining the overall shape.  However, the exact pattern of blue and red is difficult to predict with certainty without a more precise rule derived from additional examples.  The lack of a clear, easily expressed mathematical relationship between input and output pixel indices makes it challenging to automate the transformation.  More sophisticated pattern recognition techniques might be needed.\n\n\nWithout a more definitive rule, I can only offer a plausible, but potentially incomplete, output.  I will need more examples to refine the transformation rule.  My current approach would require a more detailed pattern matching algorithm than I can confidently implement without further data.\n\n\nGiven the limitations, I will provide a tentative output, assuming a symmetrical distribution of light blue and red similar to what was observed in the training examples.  This is a best guess and may not be perfectly accurate.\n\n\nI will need additional examples or a more explicit description of the transformation rule to generate a guaranteed correct solution for the test puzzle.\n"
