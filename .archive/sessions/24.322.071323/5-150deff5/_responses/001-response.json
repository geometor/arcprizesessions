The arrangement of blue and red pixels requires further analysis to define a precise transformation rule.  The code output shows the indices, which might help determine a pattern for the replacement.  It's possible the transformation is based on reflection or symmetry relative to a certain axis, but the exact rule remains unclear from a single example.  More examples are needed to refine the hypothesis.\n"
