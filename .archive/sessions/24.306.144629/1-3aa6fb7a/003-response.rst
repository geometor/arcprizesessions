Based on the two examples, the transformation involves adding pixels with value '1' (blue) to the immediate vicinity of pixels with value '8' (light blue).  The placement of these '1' pixels appears to prioritize filling in gaps or extending the overall shape formed by the '8' pixels, maintaining its general form.  The exact placement of the new '1' pixels isn't strictly deterministic from these two examples alone; more data is needed to ascertain if there's a more precise rule governing their positioning.


Let's use code to analyze the properties of the input and output grids more formally.  This will help refine our understanding of the pattern.

The code analysis reveals that the '1' pixels are added to locations neighboring the '8' pixels. The number of zero neighbors for each '8' pixel varies, suggesting that the rule isn't simply about the number of neighbors.  The placement of the '1's seems to aim at maintaining the overall shape of the '8' cluster, filling in gaps or extending edges.  More examples are crucial to precisely define the selection criteria for the placement of the '1' pixels.
