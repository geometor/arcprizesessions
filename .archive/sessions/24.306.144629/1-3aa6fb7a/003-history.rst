**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming a roughly rectangular shape, with a slightly irregular edge.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same cluster of 8s as in the input.
  - Two new '1' pixels are added to the shape in a manner that appears to fill in gaps or extend the shape slightly.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding '1' pixels to the edges of the cluster of '8's.  The addition appears to fill in gaps or extend the shape slightly, but the logic isn't immediately obvious.  More examples are needed to definitively determine the rule.  The added 1s seem to maintain the rectangular shape while filling in the gaps in the original shape.


I need more examples to understand the rule governing the addition of the blue pixels.  The current example only suggests that blue pixels might be added to gaps, but more examples are needed to confirm this.

**observations**

Here's an analysis of example_2, followed by a revised hypothesis based on both examples:

**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 8
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming a roughly 'L' shape.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 40
  - 8: 8
  - 1: 3
objects:
  - Same cluster of 8s as in the input.
  - Three new '1' pixels added around the perimeter of the cluster of 8s. They seem to fill gaps along the contour of the shape.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 3
colors_changed: Three '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.
```

**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, '1' pixels are added.  However, this example shows the addition isn't limited to filling gaps within a rectangular shape. The pattern appears to focus on filling in gaps or extending the overall shape of the 8s cluster maintaining the shape's integrity.


**Revised Hypothesis (Based on both examples):**

The transformation rule appears to be:  Identify all pixels with value '8'. Find all the neighboring pixels with value '0'.  Then, change a subset of those neighboring pixels to '1', preferentially filling in gaps or extending the overall shape defined by the '8's.  The selection of which '0' pixels to change seems somewhat arbitrary but maintains the overall shape of the '8' pixels. The number of 1's added seems to be related to the perimeter.


This hypothesis needs further testing with more examples to confirm or refine it.  The "somewhat arbitrary" aspect requires more data to determine if there's a more precise rule governing which '0' pixels become '1's.
