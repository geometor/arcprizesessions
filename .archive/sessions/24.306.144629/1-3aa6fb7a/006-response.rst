The working output grid is currently identical to the input grid.  Before proceeding with adding '1' pixels, I will use code to further analyze the candidate locations identified earlier, focusing on those that best fill gaps or extend the shapes of the '8' clusters, respecting the pattern in the examples.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                          [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    def count_neighbors(grid, value, row, col):
        count = 0
        for r in range(max(0, row - 1), min(grid.shape[0], row + 2)):
            for c in range(max(0, col - 1), min(grid.shape[1], col + 2)):
                if grid[r, c] == value and (r, c) != (row, col):
                    count += 1
        return count
    
    def find_candidates(grid):
        candidates = []
        for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
            for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
                if grid[r, c] == 0:
                    neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, 8, r, c)
                    if neighbors > 0:
                        candidates.append((r, c, neighbors))
        return candidates
    
    candidates = find_candidates(test_input)
    print("Candidate locations (row, col, number of 8 neighbors):")
    print(candidates)
    
    #Further analysis to prioritize candidates based on gap filling and shape extension
    #This requires manual inspection of the grid and the candidates to determine which ones best fit the pattern
    #This visual inspection part will be done separately.

Candidate locations (row, col, number of 8 neighbors):
[(0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (0, 4, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (1, 5, 3), (2, 1, 3), (2, 2, 2), (2, 3, 1), (2, 4, 1), (2, 5, 1), (2, 6, 1), (3, 0, 1), (3, 1, 1), (3, 2, 2), (3, 4, 3), (3, 5, 1), (4, 0, 1), (4, 1, 1), (4, 2, 3), (4, 5, 1), (5, 0, 3), (5, 2, 3), (5, 3, 2), (5, 4, 2), (5, 5, 1), (6, 2, 2)]

```

Based on the candidate locations and visual inspection of the grid, I propose the following additions of '1' pixels to the output grid. The goal is to fill in gaps and extend the shapes while maintaining consistency with the examples.

**Proposed '1' pixel additions (row, column):**

(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 2)


These additions seem to follow the pattern from the previous examples: they fill gaps in the clusters of 8's, and extend shapes in a way that is consistent with the rules observed.
