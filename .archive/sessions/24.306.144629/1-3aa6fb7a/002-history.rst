**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 42
  - 8: 6
objects:
  - A cluster of 8s forming a roughly rectangular shape, with a slightly irregular edge.
```

**Output:**

```
width: 7
height: 7
colors:
  - 0: 41
  - 8: 6
  - 1: 2
objects:
  - Same cluster of 8s as in the input.
  - Two new '1' pixels are added to the shape in a manner that appears to fill in gaps or extend the shape slightly.
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 2
colors_changed: Two '0' pixels changed to '1' pixels.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding '1' pixels to the edges of the cluster of '8's.  The addition appears to fill in gaps or extend the shape slightly, but the logic isn't immediately obvious.  More examples are needed to definitively determine the rule.  The added 1s seem to maintain the rectangular shape while filling in the gaps in the original shape.


I need more examples to understand the rule governing the addition of the blue pixels.  The current example only suggests that blue pixels might be added to gaps, but more examples are needed to confirm this.
