Orange 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to blue pixels.  The placement appears to be in direct proximity.\n\n\nThe transformation is not a simple geometric operation, but rather a rule-based addition of blocks around specific existing colors.  The size and color of the added blocks are constant.  The proximity of the new blocks to the original ones might be a key parameter, though further examples are needed to refine the rule.\n"
