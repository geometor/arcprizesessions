Existing blue and red are preserved.\n  transformation:\n    - The single red and blue pixels are preserved.\n    - A yellow 2x2 block appears above and below the red pixel.\n    - An orange 2x2 block appears around the blue pixel.\n    - The pattern seems to center around the existing red and blue pixels.\n```\n\n**Observations and Reasoning:**\n\nThe transformation isn't a simple geometric operation (rotation, mirroring, etc.). Instead, it involves the *addition* of new colored blocks based on the positions of pre-existing pixels (red and blue).  The placement of the new blocks suggests a proximity-based rule, possibly considering a certain radius around the initial pixels.  The colors of the added blocks are consistent (yellow above and below red; orange around blue).  Further examples are needed to confirm the generality and exact rules of this transformation.\n"
