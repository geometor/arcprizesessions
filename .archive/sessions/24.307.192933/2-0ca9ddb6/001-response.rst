Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (4,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,6), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Existing blue and red are preserved.
     transformation:
       - The single red and blue pixels are preserved.
       - A yellow 2x2 block appears above and below the red pixel.
       - An orange 2x2 block appears around the blue pixel.
       - The pattern seems to center around the existing red and blue pixels.

**Observations and Reasoning:**

The transformation isn't a simple geometric operation (rotation, mirroring, etc.). Instead, it involves the *addition* of new colored blocks based on the positions of pre-existing pixels (red and blue).  The placement of the new blocks suggests a proximity-based rule, possibly considering a certain radius around the initial pixels.  The colors of the added blocks are consistent (yellow above and below red; orange around blue).  Further examples are needed to confirm the generality and exact rules of this transformation.
