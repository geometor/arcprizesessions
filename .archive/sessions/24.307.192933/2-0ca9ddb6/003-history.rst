Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (4,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,6), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Existing blue and red are preserved.
     transformation:
       - The single red and blue pixels are preserved.
       - A yellow 2x2 block appears above and below the red pixel.
       - An orange 2x2 block appears around the blue pixel.
       - The pattern seems to center around the existing red and blue pixels.

**Observations and Reasoning:**

The transformation isn't a simple geometric operation (rotation, mirroring, etc.). Instead, it involves the *addition* of new colored blocks based on the positions of pre-existing pixels (red and blue).  The placement of the new blocks suggests a proximity-based rule, possibly considering a certain radius around the initial pixels.  The colors of the added blocks are consistent (yellow above and below red; orange around blue).  Further examples are needed to confirm the generality and exact rules of this transformation.

         - size: 2x2, position: (3,5), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (1,7), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (3,7), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (7,0), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (7,2), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (5,6), color: orange
         - size: 2x2, position: (5,8), color: orange
         - size: 2x2, position: (7,6), color: orange
         - size: 2x2, position: (7,8), color: orange


     differences:
       cells_changed: 24
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around existing blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, but with more instances of blue and red pixels.
       - Yellow 2x2 blocks appear around red pixels.
       - Orange 2x2 blocks appear around blue pixels.
       - The azure pixel remains unchanged.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples demonstrate a consistent pattern:


#. **Preservation of existing colors:** The original blue, red, and in example 2, azure pixels remain in their initial positions.
#. **Addition of new blocks:**  Yellow 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to red pixels. Orange 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to blue pixels.  The placement appears to be in direct proximity.

The transformation is not a simple geometric operation, but rather a rule-based addition of blocks around specific existing colors.  The size and color of the added blocks are constant.  The proximity of the new blocks to the original ones might be a key parameter, though further examples are needed to refine the rule.
