Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (4,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,6), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  Existing blue and red are preserved.
     transformation:
       - The single red and blue pixels are preserved.
       - A yellow 2x2 block appears above and below the red pixel.
       - An orange 2x2 block appears around the blue pixel.
       - The pattern seems to center around the existing red and blue pixels.

**Observations and Reasoning:**

The transformation isn't a simple geometric operation (rotation, mirroring, etc.). Instead, it involves the *addition* of new colored blocks based on the positions of pre-existing pixels (red and blue).  The placement of the new blocks suggests a proximity-based rule, possibly considering a certain radius around the initial pixels.  The colors of the added blocks are consistent (yellow above and below red; orange around blue).  Further examples are needed to confirm the generality and exact rules of this transformation.

         - size: 2x2, position: (7,6), color: orange
         - size: 2x2, position: (7,8), color: orange


     differences:
       cells_changed: 24
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around existing blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, but with more instances of blue and red pixels.
       - Yellow 2x2 blocks appear around red pixels.
       - Orange 2x2 blocks appear around blue pixels.
       - The azure pixel remains unchanged.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples demonstrate a consistent pattern:


#. **Preservation of existing colors:** The original blue, red, and in example 2, azure pixels remain in their initial positions.
#. **Addition of new blocks:**  Yellow 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to red pixels. Orange 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to blue pixels.  The placement appears to be in direct proximity.

The transformation is not a simple geometric operation, but rather a rule-based addition of blocks around specific existing colors.  The size and color of the added blocks are constant.  The proximity of the new blocks to the original ones might be a key parameter, though further examples are needed to refine the rule.

         - size: 2x2, position: (3,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,2), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around the red and blue pixels.
     transformation:
       - Red and blue pixels remain unchanged.
       - Magenta pixel remains unchanged.
       - Yellow 2x2 blocks added around the red pixel.
       - Orange 2x2 blocks added around the blue pixel.

**Summary of all three examples:**

The transformation consistently involves:


#. **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and magenta (in example 3) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
#. **Addition:**  Yellow 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to red pixels. Orange 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to blue pixels.  The magenta pixel is unaffected.

The rule seems to be specifically tied to the presence of red and blue pixels.  The proximity of the added yellow and orange blocks is immediate, forming a 3x3 or larger square around the initial pixel.  There is no apparent relationship between the initial arrangement of the red and blue pixels and the transformation.  The transformation does not affect other colors, like the magenta in example 3.

The next step is to test this hypothesis on a new input.  The algorithm would involve identifying the red and blue pixels, and then adding the appropriate colored 2x2 blocks around them.



**examples summary**



The transformation consistently adds 2x2 blocks of yellow around red pixels and 2x2 blocks of orange around blue pixels.  Other colors remain unchanged. The added blocks are directly adjacent to the red and blue pixels.  The relative positions of red and blue pixels within the input grid do not appear to influence the transformation.  The algorithm is color-specific and location-based.  There is no apparent interaction between the added blocks or any pattern in their arrangement beyond the immediate proximity to their respective trigger colors.
