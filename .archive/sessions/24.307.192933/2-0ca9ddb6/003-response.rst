   example_3:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 6: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (7,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,6), color: magenta

     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 6: (1)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,6), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (7,3), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, position: (1,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (3,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,2), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around the red and blue pixels.
     transformation:
       - Red and blue pixels remain unchanged.
       - Magenta pixel remains unchanged.
       - Yellow 2x2 blocks added around the red pixel.
       - Orange 2x2 blocks added around the blue pixel.

**Summary of all three examples:**

The transformation consistently involves:


#. **Preservation:** The original red, blue, and magenta (in example 3) pixels remain unchanged in their positions and colors.
#. **Addition:**  Yellow 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to red pixels. Orange 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to blue pixels.  The magenta pixel is unaffected.

The rule seems to be specifically tied to the presence of red and blue pixels.  The proximity of the added yellow and orange blocks is immediate, forming a 3x3 or larger square around the initial pixel.  There is no apparent relationship between the initial arrangement of the red and blue pixels and the transformation.  The transformation does not affect other colors, like the magenta in example 3.

The next step is to test this hypothesis on a new input.  The algorithm would involve identifying the red and blue pixels, and then adding the appropriate colored 2x2 blocks around them.
