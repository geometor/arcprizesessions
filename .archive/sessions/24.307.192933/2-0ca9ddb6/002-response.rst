     differences:
       cells_changed: 24
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around existing blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, but with more instances of blue and red pixels.
       - Yellow 2x2 blocks appear around red pixels.
       - Orange 2x2 blocks appear around blue pixels.
       - The azure pixel remains unchanged.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples demonstrate a consistent pattern:


#. **Preservation of existing colors:** The original blue, red, and in example 2, azure pixels remain in their initial positions.
#. **Addition of new blocks:**  Yellow 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to red pixels. Orange 2x2 blocks are added adjacent to blue pixels.  The placement appears to be in direct proximity.

The transformation is not a simple geometric operation, but rather a rule-based addition of blocks around specific existing colors.  The size and color of the added blocks are constant.  The proximity of the new blocks to the original ones might be a key parameter, though further examples are needed to refine the rule.
