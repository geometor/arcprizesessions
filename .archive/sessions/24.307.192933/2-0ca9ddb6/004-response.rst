The transformation consistently adds 2x2 blocks of yellow around red pixels and 2x2 blocks of orange around blue pixels.  Other colors remain unchanged. The added blocks are directly adjacent to the red and blue pixels.  The relative positions of red and blue pixels within the input grid do not appear to influence the transformation.  The algorithm is color-specific and location-based.  There is no apparent interaction between the added blocks or any pattern in their arrangement beyond the immediate proximity to their respective trigger colors.
