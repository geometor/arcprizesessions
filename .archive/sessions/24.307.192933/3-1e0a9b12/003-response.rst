       colors:
         - 0: 18
         - 1: 2
         - 2: 1
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,1), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,4), color: red

     output:
       width: 5
       height: 5
       colors:
         - 0: 21
         - 1: 2
         - 2: 1
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,3), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,4), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: red

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed:  The non-zero elements are moved to the bottom two rows, maintaining their relative horizontal positions and colors.

     transformation:
       - Non-zero elements are appended to the bottom two rows.
       - The order from left to right is maintained.
       - The remaining cells are filled with zeros.

**Rumination (updated again):**

Example 3 further refines the transformation rule. The non-zero elements are appended to the *bottom two rows*\ , maintaining their relative horizontal positions.  This is a crucial observation; the previous assumption of only appending to the bottom row was incorrect.  The number of rows used to accommodate the non-zero elements seems to be dynamic, adapting to the number of elements present.

My refined hypothesis is that the transformation appends the non-zero elements to the bottom-most rows, maintaining their relative horizontal positions and colors.  The number of rows used at the bottom is determined by the number of non-zero elements that need to be placed. The remaining cells are filled with zeros.

To finalize the algorithm, I need to test with more complex inputs, including:


#. A larger number of non-zero elements requiring more than two bottom rows.
#. Inputs with a non-zero bottom row already present.
#. Different configurations and distributions of non-zero elements.

With sufficiently comprehensive testing, I can formulate a robust and accurate algorithm for this transformation.
