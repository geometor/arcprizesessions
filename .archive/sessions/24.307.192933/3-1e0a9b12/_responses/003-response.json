The non-zero elements are appended to the *bottom two rows*, maintaining their relative horizontal positions.  This is a crucial observation; the previous assumption of only appending to the bottom row was incorrect.  The number of rows used to accommodate the non-zero elements seems to be dynamic, adapting to the number of elements present.\n\nMy refined hypothesis is that the transformation appends the non-zero elements to the bottom-most rows, maintaining their relative horizontal positions and colors.  The number of rows used at the bottom is determined by the number of non-zero elements that need to be placed. The remaining cells are filled with zeros.\n\nTo finalize the algorithm, I need to test with more complex inputs, including:\n\n1.  A larger number of non-zero elements requiring more than two bottom rows.\n2.  Inputs with a non-zero bottom row already present.\n3.  Different configurations and distributions of non-zero elements.\n\nWith sufficiently comprehensive testing, I can formulate a robust and accurate algorithm for this transformation.\n"
