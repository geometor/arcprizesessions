The number of rows used at the bottom to accommodate these elements is dynamic and depends on the total number of non-zero elements. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\nLet's analyze the differences in a tabular format to highlight the pattern:\n\n| Example | Input Non-zero Count | Rows Used in Output |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 5 | 1 |\n| 2 | 8 | 2 |\n| 3 | 7 | 2 |\n\nThe number of rows used in the output seems to be `ceil(non-zero_count / width)`.\n\n"

The calculation `math.ceil(non_zero_count / width)` would suggest 2 rows are needed for Example 1, but only 1 is used in the output.\n\nThis suggests that the rule might be more nuanced. Perhaps there is a minimum number of rows used, or the rule is not solely dependent on a simple calculation.  Further examples are needed to clarify this discrepancy.  The next step is to test with more examples to determine a more accurate rule for the number of rows utilized in the output.  Specifically, we should test examples where `ceil(non_zero_count/width)` is greater than 1 to see if the calculation is correct in those scenarios, and to also examine edge cases, such as grids with a non-zero bottom row in the input.\n"
