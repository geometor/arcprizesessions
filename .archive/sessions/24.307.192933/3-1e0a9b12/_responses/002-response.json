The transformation isn't just about moving non-zero elements to the bottom row; it's about *appending* them to the bottom row while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.  The bottom row is extended if necessary to accommodate all non-zero elements.  The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\nThis rule is more precise and accounts for the behavior observed in both examples.  It's crucial to consider edge cases like varying number of rows with non-zero elements, and arrangement of the non-zero elements. The examples so far don't test these edge cases extensively.\n\n\nTo further refine the understanding, I'd like to see examples with:\n\n1.  More rows of non-zero elements in the input.\n2.  Different arrangements of non-zero elements (e.g., non-contiguous blocks).\n3.  Inputs with a non-zero bottom row.\n\nOnce these edge cases are explored, I can confidently formulate a robust algorithm.\n"
