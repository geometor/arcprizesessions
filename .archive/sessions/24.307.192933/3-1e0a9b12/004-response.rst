The transformation involves appending non-zero elements from the input grid to the bottom rows of the output grid.  The horizontal order of these elements is preserved. The number of rows used at the bottom to accommodate these elements is dynamic and depends on the total number of non-zero elements. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.

Let's analyze the differences in a tabular format to highlight the pattern:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Example
     - Input Non-zero Count
     - Rows Used in Output
   * - 1
     - 5
     - 1
   * - 2
     - 8
     - 2
   * - 3
     - 7
     - 2


The number of rows used in the output seems to be ``ceil(non-zero_count / width)``.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import math

   def rows_needed(non_zero_count, width):
     return math.ceil(non_zero_count / width)

   print(f"Example 1: {rows_needed(5,4)=}")
   print(f"Example 2: {rows_needed(8,6)=}")
   print(f"Example 3: {rows_needed(7,5)=}")



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Example 1: rows_needed(5,4)=2
   Example 2: rows_needed(8,6)=2
   Example 3: rows_needed(7,5)=2



The tool output shows that my initial estimation of the number of rows needed is incorrect for Example 1.  The calculation ``math.ceil(non_zero_count / width)`` would suggest 2 rows are needed for Example 1, but only 1 is used in the output.

This suggests that the rule might be more nuanced. Perhaps there is a minimum number of rows used, or the rule is not solely dependent on a simple calculation.  Further examples are needed to clarify this discrepancy.  The next step is to test with more examples to determine a more accurate rule for the number of rows utilized in the output.  Specifically, we should test examples where ``ceil(non_zero_count/width)`` is greater than 1 to see if the calculation is correct in those scenarios, and to also examine edge cases, such as grids with a non-zero bottom row in the input.
