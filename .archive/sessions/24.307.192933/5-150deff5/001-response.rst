Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 17
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (2,2), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 75
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 17
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (2,2), color: azure, red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 17
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the overall shape.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is transformed.  The transformation appears to involve a rotation and a color change.  The top-left is azure and the bottom-right is red.  The rule is not immediately obvious.

**Initial Thoughts and Hypotheses:**

The transformation isn't a simple color change or geometric operation (rotation, translation, mirroring).  It seems more complex, possibly involving a conditional replacement rule based on the position within the gray object.  Further examples are needed to solidify the pattern.  A hypothesis would be that the change occurs in a specific pattern in relation to the original shape of the gray pixels.  More examples would help refine this hypothesis.
