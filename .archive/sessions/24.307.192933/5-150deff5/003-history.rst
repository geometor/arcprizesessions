**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 17
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (2,2), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 75
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 17
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (2,2), color: azure, red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 17
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the overall shape.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is transformed.  The transformation appears to involve a rotation and a color change.  The top-left is azure and the bottom-right is red.  The rule is not immediately obvious.

**Initial Thoughts and Hypotheses:**

The transformation isn't a simple color change or geometric operation (rotation, translation, mirroring).  It seems more complex, possibly involving a conditional replacement rule based on the position within the gray object.  Further examples are needed to solidify the pattern.  A hypothesis would be that the change occurs in a specific pattern in relation to the original shape of the gray pixels.  More examples would help refine this hypothesis.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 5: 18
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (1,1), color: gray,  shape: irregular
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 56
         - 2: 6
         - 8: 12
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (1,1), color: azure, red, shape: irregular
     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the overall shape.  The pattern seems less structured than example 1.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1: gray pixels are replaced.  The replacement pattern is less clear.  It appears that the replacement is not a simple mapping, but might be related to the position within the object.  There's a need to determine the logic behind the replacement.

**Revised Thoughts and Hypotheses:**

Both examples show a transformation where gray (5) pixels are replaced with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The shape of the original gray object is preserved. However, the *pattern* of replacement differs.  In Example 1, there appears to be a more structured arrangement (e.g., a diagonal or quadrant-based replacement). In Example 2, the pattern is less obvious, possibly more random or determined by a different rule (e.g., proximity to the edges of the gray object).

To determine the transformation rule, more examples are crucial, especially ones with varying shapes and sizes of the gray objects.   A potential next step is to systematically examine the relative positions of the red (2) and azure (8) pixels to the original gray (5) pixels to discover potential positional patterns.  I'll also test hypotheses using code to detect potential patterns.  (For example, looking for a correlation between the distance from the center of the gray shape and the color assigned).

I need more examples to confidently determine the transformation rule.
