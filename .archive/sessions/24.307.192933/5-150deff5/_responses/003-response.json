The replacement pattern is not immediately obvious but seems to maintain a rough symmetry.\n\n```\n\n**Further Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation consistently replaces gray (5) pixels with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.  The *distribution* of red and azure seems related to the position within the gray object, but the precise rule remains elusive.  It is not a simple geometric transformation or a fixed pattern; it seems more context-dependent, possibly related to the shape and density of the gray object.  However, it is likely that there's a local positional or adjacency-based rule for the red-azure distribution within the original gray shape.\n\nTo move forward, I would need to analyze additional examples.  The complexity suggests that a simple mathematical formula or single rule might not fully describe the transformation.  A possible algorithmic approach involves analyzing the neighborhood of each gray pixel and defining a rule based on its neighbors and position within the object.\n\nA more sophisticated approach might involve machine learning techniques to learn the transformation function from the provided examples.  However, given the limited data so far, more data is needed to confirm the transformation.\n"
