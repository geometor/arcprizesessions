The transformation appears to involve a rotation and a color change.  The top-left is azure and the bottom-right is red.  The rule is not immediately obvious.\n```\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Hypotheses:**\n\nThe transformation isn't a simple color change or geometric operation (rotation, translation, mirroring).  It seems more complex, possibly involving a conditional replacement rule based on the position within the gray object.  Further examples are needed to solidify the pattern.  A hypothesis would be that the change occurs in a specific pattern in relation to the original shape of the gray pixels.  More examples would help refine this hypothesis.\n"
