There might be subtle spatial or adjacency dependencies between original gray pixels and their resulting color, but without a larger dataset, this is just speculation.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the following strategy for generating a test output:\n\n1. **Initialize:** Create an output array of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.\n\n2. **Iterate:** For each cell in the input array:\n    * If the cell's value is 5 (gray):\n        * Determine a replacement color based on a simple heuristic (e.g., randomly assign 2 or 8 based on a probability which might help with maintaining balance if more examples showed some bias).  More advanced techniques could consider local neighbors, but given the ambiguity in the patterns, this approach is reasonable given the available data.\n\n3. **Output:** The resulting array will be the generated output.\n\n\n"
