Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82

       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (2,2), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 75
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 17
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (2,2), color: azure, red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 17
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the overall shape.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is transformed.  The transformation appears to involve a rotation and a color change.  The top-left is azure and the bottom-right is red.  The rule is not immediately obvious.

**Initial Thoughts and Hypotheses:**

The transformation isn't a simple color change or geometric operation (rotation, translation, mirroring).  It seems more complex, possibly involving a conditional replacement rule based on the position within the gray object.  Further examples are needed to solidify the pattern.  A hypothesis would be that the change occurs in a specific pattern in relation to the original shape of the gray pixels.  More examples would help refine this hypothesis.

       width: 10

         - 5: 18

     output:

       colors:
         - 0: 56
         - 2: 6
         - 8: 12
       objects:
         - size: 7x7, position: (1,1), color: azure, red, shape: irregular
     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the overall shape.  The pattern seems less structured than example 1.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1: gray pixels are replaced.  The replacement pattern is less clear.  It appears that the replacement is not a simple mapping, but might be related to the position within the object.  There's a need to determine the logic behind the replacement.

**Revised Thoughts and Hypotheses:**

Both examples show a transformation where gray (5) pixels are replaced with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.  The shape of the original gray object is preserved. However, the *pattern* of replacement differs.  In Example 1, there appears to be a more structured arrangement (e.g., a diagonal or quadrant-based replacement). In Example 2, the pattern is less obvious, possibly more random or determined by a different rule (e.g., proximity to the edges of the gray object).

To determine the transformation rule, more examples are crucial, especially ones with varying shapes and sizes of the gray objects.   A potential next step is to systematically examine the relative positions of the red (2) and azure (8) pixels to the original gray (5) pixels to discover potential positional patterns.  I'll also test hypotheses using code to detect potential patterns.  (For example, looking for a correlation between the distance from the center of the gray shape and the color assigned).

I need more examples to confidently determine the transformation rule.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced by red and azure pixels. The pattern is again irregular.
     transformation:
       - Gray pixels are replaced by a combination of red and azure pixels.  The replacement pattern is not immediately obvious but seems to maintain a rough symmetry.

**Further Refined Hypothesis:**

The transformation consistently replaces gray (5) pixels with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.  The *distribution* of red and azure seems related to the position within the gray object, but the precise rule remains elusive.  It is not a simple geometric transformation or a fixed pattern; it seems more context-dependent, possibly related to the shape and density of the gray object.  However, it is likely that there's a local positional or adjacency-based rule for the red-azure distribution within the original gray shape.

To move forward, I would need to analyze additional examples.  The complexity suggests that a simple mathematical formula or single rule might not fully describe the transformation.  A possible algorithmic approach involves analyzing the neighborhood of each gray pixel and defining a rule based on its neighbors and position within the object.

A more sophisticated approach might involve machine learning techniques to learn the transformation function from the provided examples.  However, given the limited data so far, more data is needed to confirm the transformation.



**examples summary**



The transformation consistently replaces gray (5) pixels with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels. The distribution of red and azure within the transformed object is not consistent across examples, suggesting a more complex rule than a simple geometric transformation or a fixed pattern.  The examples suggest that the rule is context-dependent, possibly related to the shape, size, and density of the gray object.  There may also be a local positional or adjacency-based rule determining the red-azure distribution within the original gray shape.

Let's explore potential patterns using code. We'll focus on the relative positions of the resulting red (2) and azure (8) pixels compared to the original gray (5) pixels in each example.

The code provides the indices of gray, red, and azure pixels.  However, a clear pattern isn't immediately evident from this raw data.  More sophisticated analysis (e.g., calculating distances to the centroid of the gray object, applying spatial autocorrelation analysis) would be needed to reveal any underlying positional rules.  Additional examples are also crucial for confirming and refining hypotheses about the transformation.  The lack of a clear pattern from this simple analysis suggests the transformation might be more complex or less rule-based than initially thought.

Based on the previous examples and the analysis, I can't definitively determine a precise rule for the transformation.  The distribution of red and azure pixels within the transformed gray areas seems to be irregular and doesn't show an obvious pattern.  There might be subtle spatial or adjacency dependencies between original gray pixels and their resulting color, but without a larger dataset, this is just speculation.

Therefore, I will proceed with the following strategy for generating a test output:


#. 
   **Initialize:** Create an output array of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.

#. 
   **Iterate:** For each cell in the input array:


   * If the cell's value is 5 (gray):

     * Determine a replacement color based on a simple heuristic (e.g., randomly assign 2 or 8 based on a probability which might help with maintaining balance if more examples showed some bias).  More advanced techniques could consider local neighbors, but given the ambiguity in the patterns, this approach is reasonable given the available data.

#. 
   **Output:** The resulting array will be the generated output.

This is a probabilistic solution;  because there's no clear deterministic rule, using random assignment with equal probability for 2 and 8 is a reasonable approach given the data.  A more sophisticated approach would require significantly more examples to identify any potential patterns or underlying rule and would need to use machine learning techniques to train a model to predict the correct output.  However this approach provides a plausible solution given the current data.
