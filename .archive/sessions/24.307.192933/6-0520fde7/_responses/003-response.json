Size decreased.\n  transformation:\n    - Similar size reduction as example 1 and 2.\n    - The central 5 in the input is related to the placement of 2's in the output. The pattern is two 2's at opposite corners.\n    - Blue pixels are removed.\n    - The reduction in size appears to be a fixed amount, resulting in a 3x3 output.\n\n```\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation remains consistent with the previous hypothesis. The core logic is to extract the central 3x3 region of the input. The '5' in the center influences the placement of '2's in the output 3x3 grid.  The surrounding colors (1 and 0) determine the *pattern* of '2's within the output, not their presence or absence.\n\n- If the central 3x3 area around '5' has only '0's, there is one '2' in the center of the output.\n- If the central 3x3 area around '5' has '1's and '0's and is symmetrical, there are four '2's in a plus-sign pattern in the output.\n- if the central 3x3 area around '5' has '1's and '0's and is asymmetrical, there are two '2's diagonally opposite each other in the output.\n\nAll other cells in the output are '0'.  The input grid size reduces to a 3x3 grid.  Blue pixels are removed.\n\n\nThe next step would involve testing this hypothesis with additional examples to verify its robustness and potentially identify edge cases or refine the rules.\n"
