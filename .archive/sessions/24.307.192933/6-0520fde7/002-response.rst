   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 11
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: center, color: gray (5)
         - size: varies, position: around gray square, color: blue (1)
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 6
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: corners and center, color: red (2)
     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Input colors 1 and 5 are gone; output has only 0 and 2. Size decreased.
     transformation:
       - Similar size reduction as example 1.
       - The central 5 in the input is related to the placement of 2's in the output.  The pattern is a plus sign.
       - Blue pixels are removed.
       - The reduction in size appears to be a fixed amount, resulting in a 3x3 output.

**Ruminate Phase:**

Based on the two examples, several observations can be made about the transformation:


#. 
   **Size Reduction:** The input grid is always reduced to a 3x3 output grid.  The central 3x3 region of the input seems relevant.

#. 
   **Central Element:** The central 3x3 section of the input grid plays a crucial role.  The value '5' in this central region appears to influence the output. Specifically:


   * If the central '5' is surrounded only by zeros, the output is a single '2' in the center.
   * If the central '5' is surrounded by ones and zeros, the output is a plus sign of '2's.


#. **Color Removal:** Blue (1) pixels are always removed.


#. **Background Color:** The remaining cells are filled with white (0).

**Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves focusing on the central 3x3 area of the input. The value '5' in this area determines the pattern of '2's in the 3x3 output grid.  The surrounding colors are ignored, and all other cells are set to white (0).

The transformation is a simplification, focusing on a specific central part of the input.  Further examples are needed to confirm the hypothesis and potentially uncover more details.  The relationship between the surrounding colors and the placement of the '2's might not be fixed in these two examples.
