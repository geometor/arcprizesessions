Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 4
         - 5: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: center, color: gray (5)
         - size: varies, position: around gray square, color: blue (1)
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: center, color: red (2)
     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Input colors 1 and 5 are gone; output has only 0 and 2.  Size decreased significantly.
     transformation:
       - The output grid is much smaller than the input.
       - The central 5 in the input is replaced with 2 in the output.
       - Most cells become 0.
       - There is a drastic reduction in the size of the grid.  It's not clear yet if the size reduction is predictable.
       - The blue pixels are removed from the output.

The transformation isn't immediately obvious.  The central gray square in the input seems to be related to the central red square in the output, but the size reduction and elimination of blue pixels require further investigation.  More examples are needed to discern the complete transformation rules.
