**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to change some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, it seems to change the pixels in the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main cluster of azure pixels.  More examples are needed to confirm the rule.

My initial hypothesis is that the transformation involves changing certain azure pixels to blue pixels.  The specific locations of these changes are not immediately apparent, and more examples would be needed to define a reliable rule.  The changed pixels seem to be on the perimeter of the main group of azure pixels.

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: (2,2), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: (2,2), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The changed pixels appear to be on the perimeter of the main azure object, specifically corners and edges.

After reviewing both examples, the transformation seems consistent:  Azure pixels at the edges or corners of a contiguous group of azure pixels are changed to blue.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the shape of the azure object.  There's no apparent pattern beyond this edge/corner detection.
