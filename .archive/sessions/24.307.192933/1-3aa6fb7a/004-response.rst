The provided examples and the analysis suggest a transformation where some azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1).  However, the rule for selecting which azure pixels to change isn't fully defined by the two examples.  The code analysis confirmed this ambiguity.  The simple edge/corner detection hypothesis is insufficient.

To proceed with the test input, I will adopt a cautious approach.  I will initially assume that only some, but not necessarily all, azure pixels at edges or corners will be changed to blue.  I will visually inspect the test input and apply changes incrementally.

**Test Input Analysis:**

The test input has a larger, more complex arrangement of azure pixels than the examples. There are multiple clusters of azure pixels.

Let's initialize the output grid from the input grid.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   test_output = np.copy(test_input)
   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



Now, I will iteratively change some azure pixels to blue, guided by the patterns observed in the examples. I will focus on azure pixels that are at the edges or corners of clusters.

**Iteration 1:** Let's change the top-rightmost azure pixel (row 0, column 6).



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   test_output[0, 6] = 1
   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



**Iteration 2:**  Let's change the bottom-leftmost azure pixel (row 6, column 0).



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   test_output[6, 0] = 1
   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



**Iteration 3:** The azure pixel at (1,0) is at the edge of a cluster. Let's change that to blue.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   test_output[1,0] = 1
   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



I'm not entirely confident in this solution, as the transformation rule remains unclear.  However, given the limited examples and the incremental nature of the changes, this output represents a reasonable attempt based on the observed patterns.  Further examples would greatly aid in defining a more precise and accurate transformation rule.  Submitting this output for evaluation will provide valuable feedback for future improvement.
