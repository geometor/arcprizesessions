   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: (2,2), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: (2,2), color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The changed pixels appear to be on the perimeter of the main azure object, specifically corners and edges.

After reviewing both examples, the transformation seems consistent:  Azure pixels at the edges or corners of a contiguous group of azure pixels are changed to blue.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the shape of the azure object.  There's no apparent pattern beyond this edge/corner detection.
