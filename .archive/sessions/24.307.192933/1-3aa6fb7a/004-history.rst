     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to change some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, it seems to change the pixels in the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main cluster of azure pixels.  More examples are needed to confirm the rule.

My initial hypothesis is that the transformation involves changing certain azure pixels to blue pixels.  The specific locations of these changes are not immediately apparent, and more examples would be needed to define a reliable rule.  The changed pixels seem to be on the perimeter of the main group of azure pixels.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, azure pixels are changed to blue. The changed pixels appear to be on the perimeter of the main azure object, specifically corners and edges.

After reviewing both examples, the transformation seems consistent:  Azure pixels at the edges or corners of a contiguous group of azure pixels are changed to blue.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the shape of the azure object.  There's no apparent pattern beyond this edge/corner detection.



**examples summary**



The transformation consistently changes azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The specific azure pixels affected are those located at the edges or corners of a connected group of azure pixels.  The number of pixels changed depends on the size and shape of the azure object.

Let's summarize the findings in code to confirm the pattern:



code_execution:

   import numpy as np

   def analyze_transformation(input_grid, output_grid):
       """Analyzes the transformation between input and output grids."""
       input_array = np.array(input_grid)
       output_array = np.array(output_grid)
       diff_array = output_array - input_array
       changed_pixels = np.where(diff_array != 0)
       changed_count = len(changed_pixels[0])

       azure_indices = np.where(input_array == 8)
       azure_count = len(azure_indices[0])

       blue_indices = np.where(output_array == 1)
       blue_count = len(blue_indices[0])

       print(f"Number of pixels changed: {changed_count}")
       print(f"Number of azure pixels in input: {azure_count}")
       print(f"Number of blue pixels in output: {blue_count}")

       #Check if changes only involve azure to blue.
       for i in range(changed_count):
           x,y = changed_pixels[0][i], changed_pixels[1][i]
           if input_array[x,y] != 8 or output_array[x,y] != 1:
               print("Error: Not all changes are from azure to blue.")
               return

       # Find connected components of azure pixels.  This part is complex and requires a more advanced image processing library.
       # For simplicity, we will skip detailed connected component analysis for now, and rely on visual inspection.

   Number of pixels changed: 2

   Error: Not all changes are from azure to blue.



The ``Error`` messages from the code indicate that my initial hypothesis is oversimplified. While the transformation does involve changing some azure pixels to blue, it's not solely based on edge/corner detection. The provided examples are insufficient to determine the exact rule because in both examples some azure pixels remain unchanged despite being at the edges of the group.  More examples are needed to refine the hypothesis.  A more sophisticated approach using connected component analysis might be necessary to correctly identify the specific transformation rule.
