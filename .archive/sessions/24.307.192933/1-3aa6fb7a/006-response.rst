The working output grid is a copy of the input grid. I need to make changes based on the patterns observed in the previous examples.  My current hypothesis, while imperfect, suggests changing azure pixels at the edges or corners of clusters to blue.  However, this rule is not perfectly precise based on the limited examples.

Let's review the changes made so far and see if they align with the observed patterns and refine my hypothesis.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1],
                             [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                             [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                             [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   # Find coordinates of changed pixels.
   diff = working_output - test_input
   changed_pixels = np.where(diff != 0)
   print(f"Changed pixels coordinates: {list(zip(changed_pixels[0], changed_pixels[1]))}")

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Changed pixels coordinates: [(0, 6), (1, 0), (6, 0)]

The changed pixels (0,6), (1,0), (6,0) are indeed at the edges of azure clusters.  However, there are other edge/corner azure pixels that remain unchanged.  This reinforces the ambiguity of the transformation rule.  Without more examples, a precise rule is difficult to define.  My current approach is to cautiously modify only a few easily identifiable edge/corner pixels, avoiding overfitting to the limited data.

I will submit the current ``working_output`` grid.  It represents a reasonable attempt based on the limited information available, although it might not be a perfect solution due to the uncertainty in the transformation rule.
