            "text": "The transformation applied to the input grids to produce the output grids is a deterministic substitution cipher. Each color (represented by a number 0-9) in the input grid is mapped to a specific color in the output grid. This mapping is consistent across all examples.  The mapping is not a simple arithmetic or geometric operation; it's a direct color-to-color replacement.\n\nBased on the four examples, we've determined the following partial mapping:\n\n* 1 -> 5\n* 2 -> 6\n* 3 -> 4\n* 4 -> 3\n* 5 -> 1\n* 6 -> 2\n* 8 -> 9\n* 9 -> 8\n\nColors 0 and 7 remain unmapped.  To complete the mapping, and to improve the robustness of our understanding,  additional examples are needed, particularly those containing colors 0 and 7 in the input.  Once the complete mapping is established, we can confidently predict the output for any given input grid.  The solution will involve iterating through each cell of the input grid and applying the established substitution cipher to determine the corresponding color in the output grid.\n\nTo facilitate the solution process for a test input, a python dictionary representing the complete substitution mapping will be extremely beneficial.  Once we have the complete mapping, the transformation can be implemented efficiently using Python's dictionary lookup capabilities.\n"
