The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.\n\n```\n\nNow, let's combine the observations from all three examples to refine the substitution cipher:\n\n* Example 1: 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4\n* Example 2: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9\n* Example 3: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2\n\nThis gives us a more complete mapping:\n\n* 1 -> 5\n* 2 -> 6\n* 3 -> 4\n* 5 -> 1\n* 6 -> 2\n* 8 -> 9\n\nThis mapping is consistent across all three examples.  We still don't have mappings for 0, 4, and 7.  However, based on the pattern observed, it's highly likely this is a fixed substitution cipher.  Additional examples could confirm if it's a complete mapping or there is some other logic.  The mapping does not seem to follow any obvious mathematical or geometric relationship.  It's purely a color substitution.  More data is required to determine the full mapping and confidently predict the output for unseen inputs.\n"
