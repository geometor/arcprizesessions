   example_2:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 2: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 8: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: red, green, azure
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 6: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 9: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: magenta, yellow, maroon
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

Combining the observations from example_1 and example_2, we can start to deduce the substitution cipher:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 8 -> 9

This suggests a pattern, but we need more examples to confirm if this mapping is complete and generalizes to other colors.  The mapping doesn't appear to be a simple arithmetic or geometric transformation.  It's a direct color substitution.  We should wait for additional examples before making a definitive conclusion.
