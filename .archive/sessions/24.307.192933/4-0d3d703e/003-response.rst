   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: gray, azure, magenta
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: blue, maroon, red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

Now, let's combine the observations from all three examples to refine the substitution cipher:


* Example 1: 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4
* Example 2: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9
* Example 3: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2

This gives us a more complete mapping:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 5 -> 1
* 6 -> 2
* 8 -> 9

This mapping is consistent across all three examples.  We still don't have mappings for 0, 4, and 7.  However, based on the pattern observed, it's highly likely this is a fixed substitution cipher.  Additional examples could confirm if it's a complete mapping or there is some other logic.  The mapping does not seem to follow any obvious mathematical or geometric relationship.  It's purely a color substitution.  More data is required to determine the full mapping and confidently predict the output for unseen inputs.
