     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

The transformation appears to be a simple substitution cipher where each color in the input is replaced with a different color in the output.  There's a one-to-one mapping between the input and output colors. To determine the exact mapping, more examples would be helpful.

       colors:

         - 3: 3
         - 8: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: red, green, azure
     output:

       colors:

       objects:

     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

Combining the observations from example_1 and example_2, we can start to deduce the substitution cipher:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 8 -> 9

This suggests a pattern, but we need more examples to confirm if this mapping is complete and generalizes to other colors.  The mapping doesn't appear to be a simple arithmetic or geometric transformation.  It's a direct color substitution.  We should wait for additional examples before making a definitive conclusion.

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: gray, azure, magenta
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: blue, maroon, red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

Now, let's combine the observations from all three examples to refine the substitution cipher:


* Example 1: 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4
* Example 2: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9
* Example 3: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2

This gives us a more complete mapping:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 5 -> 1
* 6 -> 2
* 8 -> 9

This mapping is consistent across all three examples.  We still don't have mappings for 0, 4, and 7.  However, based on the pattern observed, it's highly likely this is a fixed substitution cipher.  Additional examples could confirm if it's a complete mapping or there is some other logic.  The mapping does not seem to follow any obvious mathematical or geometric relationship.  It's purely a color substitution.  More data is required to determine the full mapping and confidently predict the output for unseen inputs.

   :alt: _images/003-example_4_output.png



**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_4:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 9: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: maroon, yellow, red
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 8: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: azure, green, magenta
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

Now, let's update the substitution cipher based on example_4:


* Example 1: 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4
* Example 2: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9
* Example 3: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2
* Example 4: 9 -> 8, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6

The mapping is becoming clearer:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 4 -> 3
* 5 -> 1
* 6 -> 2
* 8 -> 9
* 9 -> 8

We still need the mappings for 0 and 7.  However, we can now confidently predict outputs for inputs containing the colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  The transformation remains a consistent, deterministic substitution cipher. There's no obvious mathematical or geometric pattern to the mapping. It's a direct, color-to-color substitution.  We need additional examples to fully determine the mapping for all 10 colors.



**examples summary**



The transformation applied to the input grids to produce the output grids is a deterministic substitution cipher. Each color (represented by a number 0-9) in the input grid is mapped to a specific color in the output grid. This mapping is consistent across all examples.  The mapping is not a simple arithmetic or geometric operation; it's a direct color-to-color replacement.

Based on the four examples, we've determined the following partial mapping:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 4 -> 3
* 5 -> 1
* 6 -> 2
* 8 -> 9
* 9 -> 8

Colors 0 and 7 remain unmapped.  To complete the mapping, and to improve the robustness of our understanding,  additional examples are needed, particularly those containing colors 0 and 7 in the input.  Once the complete mapping is established, we can confidently predict the output for any given input grid.  The solution will involve iterating through each cell of the input grid and applying the established substitution cipher to determine the corresponding color in the output grid.

To facilitate the solution process for a test input, a python dictionary representing the complete substitution mapping will be extremely beneficial.  Once we have the complete mapping, the transformation can be implemented efficiently using Python's dictionary lookup capabilities.
