   example_4:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 9: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: maroon, yellow, red
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 8: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: (0,0), color: azure, green, magenta
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: all cells changed to different colors.
     transformation:
       - Each color in input is mapped to a different color in the output.  The mapping appears to be consistent across all cells.  A simple substitution cipher is likely.

Now, let's update the substitution cipher based on example_4:


* Example 1: 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4
* Example 2: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9
* Example 3: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2
* Example 4: 9 -> 8, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6

The mapping is becoming clearer:


* 1 -> 5
* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 4 -> 3
* 5 -> 1
* 6 -> 2
* 8 -> 9
* 9 -> 8

We still need the mappings for 0 and 7.  However, we can now confidently predict outputs for inputs containing the colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  The transformation remains a consistent, deterministic substitution cipher. There's no obvious mathematical or geometric pattern to the mapping. It's a direct, color-to-color substitution.  We need additional examples to fully determine the mapping for all 10 colors.
