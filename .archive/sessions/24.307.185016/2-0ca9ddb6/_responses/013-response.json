            "text": "The `set_range(1, 0, 2, 1, 7)` call adds a 2x2 block of orange (7) pixels starting at (1,0).  This is another partial step in the transformation process, but without a clear and consistent rule set, it's impossible to definitively say whether this is correct.\n\nThe placement partially agrees with the idea of placing blocks diagonally adjacent to the red (2) and blue (1) pixels.  However, the previous examples were not consistent enough to establish a reliable rule. The function attempts to place a 2x2 block of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the red and blue pixels; however, it lacks precise handling of the overlaps, and placement near the edges.\n\nTo proceed, I need more consistent examples.  The current working grid is still incomplete and cannot be verified as correct without a definitive rule and more data. Please provide at least five more examples covering various scenarios, including edge cases, multiple target pixels, and potential overlaps.  This will allow for a precise algorithm to be developed, avoiding the current situation where the steps are only partly justified based on an uncertain and incomplete rule set.\n"
