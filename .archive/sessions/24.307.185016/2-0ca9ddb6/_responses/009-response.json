            "text": "The `set_range` function call `set_range(1, 2, 2, 3, 4)` attempts to set a range of cells from (1,2) to (2,3) to the color yellow (4).  This is a partial application of what appears to be intended as part of a larger transformation pattern. However, given the lack of clarity in the rules and inconsistencies across examples, I cannot confirm if this change is consistent with the overarching transformation.\n\nTo verify if this is correct, I would need to see more examples and a clarified explanation of the transformation rules.  The previous examples showed inconsistent results making it impossible to create a fully reliable `transform_grid` function. The current `transform_grid` function remains incomplete and requires more data for its completion and verification.\n\nMy analysis of the provided examples suggests a pattern of adding 2x2 blocks of yellow and orange around red and blue pixels, but the precise rules for placement, overlap, and boundary conditions remain unclear. Until these ambiguities are resolved via more examples, I cannot confidently assess the correctness of the current `set_range` action and subsequent grid transformations. I need more information to confirm the rule.  Specifically, additional examples covering edge cases, overlaps, and interactions between colors are needed.  Without additional examples, any further changes are speculative.\n"
