The rule appears consistent across examples.\n```\n\nThe pattern is consistent.  For each blue and red pixel, a yellow block appears to its upper right and lower left (or vice versa if it's close to an edge, accounting for wrapping) and an orange block appears to its upper left and lower right.  This is consistent across both examples. The azure pixel remains unchanged.  The size of the added blocks appears fixed at 2x2.\n\nNext steps:  The next step is to attempt to generate an output based on a new input grid, using the discovered transformation rules.  To ensure robustness, it would be beneficial to test edge cases (pixels near the edge of the grid).  A more formal algorithm should be created based on these observations to ensure accuracy and efficiency in processing larger or more complex grids.\n"
