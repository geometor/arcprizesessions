**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue

     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  The yellow and orange are arranged symmetrically around the original red and blue pixels.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add yellow and orange blocks symmetrically around the existing red and blue pixels.  The pattern is not fully apparent in just one example, more examples are needed to confirm the precise rule.  The size and position of the added blocks is not immediately evident.

**Additional Questions:**

To fully understand the transformation, more examples are needed.  Specifically, I'd like to see examples that address the following:


#. 
   **Consistency of the pattern:** Does the pattern of adding yellow and orange blocks remain consistent when the initial red and blue pixels are in different locations?

#. 
   **Varying Initial Colors:** Are yellow and orange blocks added for other colors or only red and blue?

#. 
   **Grid Size:** What happens if the grid size changes, affecting the distance to the edges?

#. 
   **Multiple Red/Blue:** What happens if the input grid contains multiple red and/or blue pixels?  Do blocks appear around each one, and do these blocks overlap?

#. 
   **Obstruction:** What happens when the red or blue pixel is near or touching the edge of the grid?

Providing more examples will significantly aid in clarifying the transformation rules and formulating a robust solution.

         - size: 2x2, positions: [(5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange 2x2 blocks symmetrically around each blue and red pixel.  The rule appears consistent across examples.

The pattern is consistent.  For each blue and red pixel, a yellow block appears to its upper right and lower left (or vice versa if it's close to an edge, accounting for wrapping) and an orange block appears to its upper left and lower right.  This is consistent across both examples. The azure pixel remains unchanged.  The size of the added blocks appears fixed at 2x2.

Next steps:  The next step is to attempt to generate an output based on a new input grid, using the discovered transformation rules.  To ensure robustness, it would be beneficial to test edge cases (pixels near the edge of the grid).  A more formal algorithm should be created based on these observations to ensure accuracy and efficiency in processing larger or more complex grids.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange blocks symmetrically around the existing red and blue pixels, similar to previous examples.  Magenta remains unchanged.

The pattern remains consistent across all three examples.  The algorithm appears to identify red and blue pixels.  Then, it adds a 2x2 block of yellow and orange pixels symmetrically around each of these target pixels. The placement of yellow and orange blocks seems to be based on the position of the target pixel relative to the grid's edges.  If placing a block would extend outside of the grid, it seems to "wrap around" to the opposite side.  Other colors remain unchanged.  This observation needs further testing with additional examples, especially ones with multiple red and blue pixels near edges or each other, and with differently sized grids.
