**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue

     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  The yellow and orange are arranged symmetrically around the original red and blue pixels.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add yellow and orange blocks symmetrically around the existing red and blue pixels.  The pattern is not fully apparent in just one example, more examples are needed to confirm the precise rule.  The size and position of the added blocks is not immediately evident.

**Additional Questions:**

To fully understand the transformation, more examples are needed.  Specifically, I'd like to see examples that address the following:


#. 
   **Consistency of the pattern:** Does the pattern of adding yellow and orange blocks remain consistent when the initial red and blue pixels are in different locations?

#. 
   **Varying Initial Colors:** Are yellow and orange blocks added for other colors or only red and blue?

#. 
   **Grid Size:** What happens if the grid size changes, affecting the distance to the edges?

#. 
   **Multiple Red/Blue:** What happens if the input grid contains multiple red and/or blue pixels?  Do blocks appear around each one, and do these blocks overlap?

#. 
   **Obstruction:** What happens when the red or blue pixel is near or touching the edge of the grid?

Providing more examples will significantly aid in clarifying the transformation rules and formulating a robust solution.

         - size: 2x2, positions: [(5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange blocks around blue and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange 2x2 blocks symmetrically around each blue and red pixel.  The rule appears consistent across examples.

The pattern is consistent.  For each blue and red pixel, a yellow block appears to its upper right and lower left (or vice versa if it's close to an edge, accounting for wrapping) and an orange block appears to its upper left and lower right.  This is consistent across both examples. The azure pixel remains unchanged.  The size of the added blocks appears fixed at 2x2.

Next steps:  The next step is to attempt to generate an output based on a new input grid, using the discovered transformation rules.  To ensure robustness, it would be beneficial to test edge cases (pixels near the edge of the grid).  A more formal algorithm should be created based on these observations to ensure accuracy and efficiency in processing larger or more complex grids.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange blocks symmetrically around the existing red and blue pixels, similar to previous examples.  Magenta remains unchanged.

The pattern remains consistent across all three examples.  The algorithm appears to identify red and blue pixels.  Then, it adds a 2x2 block of yellow and orange pixels symmetrically around each of these target pixels. The placement of yellow and orange blocks seems to be based on the position of the target pixel relative to the grid's edges.  If placing a block would extend outside of the grid, it seems to "wrap around" to the opposite side.  Other colors remain unchanged.  This observation needs further testing with additional examples, especially ones with multiple red and blue pixels near edges or each other, and with differently sized grids.



**examples summary**



Based on the three examples, the transformation rule appears to be as follows:


#. 
   **Identify Target Pixels:** The algorithm identifies all pixels with values 1 (blue) and 2 (red).

#. 
   **Add Yellow Blocks:** For each target pixel, it adds a 2x2 block of yellow (4) pixels.  The placement of the yellow block is relative to the target pixel:  one yellow pixel is diagonally above and to the right, and another diagonally below and to the left.  If the placement of a yellow pixel would extend beyond the grid boundary, it wraps around to the opposite side.

#. 
   **Add Orange Blocks:** Similarly, for each target pixel, a 2x2 block of orange (7) pixels is added. One orange pixel is diagonally above and to the left, and the other is diagonally below and to the right.  Again, boundary wrapping occurs.

#. 
   **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

The provided code is a good starting point but has a minor flaw.  It correctly identifies the target pixels (1 and 2) and attempts to place the yellow and orange blocks. However, the logic for placing the blocks is not entirely accurate.

Here's a refined version that addresses the positioning and boundary conditions more robustly:



code_execution:

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(input_grid):
       rows, cols = input_grid.shape
       output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if input_grid[r, c] == 1 or input_grid[r, c] == 2:
                   # Yellow block
                   yr1, yc1 = (r - 1) % rows, (c + 1) % cols
                   yr2, yc2 = (r + 1) % rows, (c - 1) % cols
                   if 0 <= yr1 < rows and 0 <= yc1 < cols:
                       output_grid[yr1, yc1] = 4
                   if 0 <= yr2 < rows and 0 <= yc2 < cols:
                       output_grid[yr2, yc2] = 4

                   # Orange block
                   or1, oc1 = (r - 1) % rows, (c - 1) % cols
                   or2, oc2 = (r + 1) % rows, (c + 1) % cols
                   if 0 <= or1 < rows and 0 <= oc1 < cols:
                       output_grid[or1, oc1] = 7
                   if 0 <= or2 < rows and 0 <= oc2 < cols:
                       output_grid[or2, oc2] = 7

       return output_grid

   # Example usage (using example_1):
   example_1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

The corrected code is still not producing the expected output for example 1.  The issue is in the placement logic of the orange and yellow blocks:


* The code calculates the positions correctly, but it only places *one* pixel of each color.  The rule requires a 2x2 block to be placed.

Here's a further refined version to correctly place the 2x2 blocks:



code_execution:

           for c in range(cols):
               if input_grid[r, c] == 1 or input_grid[r, c] == 2:
                   # Yellow block
                   yr1, yc1 = (r - 1) % rows, (c + 1) % cols
                   yr2, yc2 = (r + 1) % rows, (c - 1) % cols
                   if 0 <= yr1 < rows and 0 <= yc1 < cols:
                       output_grid[yr1, yc1] = 4
                       if 0 <= yr1 + 1 < rows and 0 <= yc1 < cols:
                           output_grid[yr1 + 1, yc1] = 4

The output is still incorrect.  The problem lies in how the code handles the 2x2 block placement. It attempts to place all four pixels regardless of boundary conditions.  This leads to overlapping and incorrect placement.

Let's revise the code to ensure that only the 2x2 block that fully fits within the grid is placed:



code_execution:

   def transform_grid(input_grid):
       rows, cols = input_grid.shape
       output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

                   #Check for boundary condition
                   if 0 <= yr1 < rows and 0 <= yc1 < cols and 0 <= yr1 + 1 < rows and 0 <= yc1 + 1 < cols:
                       output_grid[yr1:yr1+2, yc1:yc1+2] = 4


                   # Orange block
                   or1, oc1 = (r - 1) % rows, (c - 1) % cols
                   #Check for boundary condition
                   if 0 <= or1 < rows and 0 <= oc1 < cols and 0 <= or1 + 1 < rows and 0 <= oc1 + 1 < cols:
                       output_grid[or1:or1+2, oc1:oc1+2] = 7


       return output_grid

The output is still not correct. The main problem is that the logic incorrectly assumes that the 2x2 blocks will always fit without overlapping.

Here's a final attempt at a corrected function that accurately places the 2x2 blocks, handling edge cases and overlaps correctly:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(input_grid):
       rows, cols = input_grid.shape
       output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

           for c in range(cols):
               if input_grid[r, c] in [1, 2]:  # More concise check
                   # Yellow block
                   yr, yc = r - 1, c + 1
                   if 0 <= yr < rows and 0 <= yc < cols and 0 <= yr + 1 < rows and 0 <= yc + 1 < cols:
                       output_grid[yr:yr + 2, yc:yc + 2] = 4

                   # Orange block
                   or1, oc1 = r - 1, c - 1
                   if 0 <= or1 < rows and 0 <= oc1 < cols and 0 <= or1 + 1 < rows and 0 <= oc1 + 1 < cols:
                       output_grid[or1:or1 + 2, oc1:oc1 + 2] = 7

       return output_grid

   # Test with example_1
   example_1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output = transform_grid(example_1_input)
   print(output)

The code is still producing the wrong output for example 1. The problem stems from the modulo operator (\ ``%``\ ) used for handling boundary conditions. This operator handles wraparound correctly, but the logic is flawed.  It needs to check for the full 2x2 area to be within bounds and place the blocks only when the entire 2x2 area is valid.

Let's rectify the code:



code_execution:

The output for example 1 is still incorrect. The code needs to accurately handle the placement of the 2x2 blocks considering both the target pixel and the grid boundaries.  The current code is not consistently applying the rule.  The problem is likely in the coordinate calculations. The placement of the orange and yellow blocks around the blue and red pixels should be consistent, forming a 2x2 block with each color in the correct relative positions.  The logic needs more refinement to ensure that these blocks are always placed correctly relative to each other.

I need to review the logic of the conditional statements for the placement to verify that boundary conditions are perfectly handled.  The ``if`` statements checking boundaries are sufficient for the individual pixels, but they must be adapted to ensure both that the blocks never fall out of bounds and that they do not overlap with each other.  Additionally, it appears that in example 2,  a yellow block is placed at (0,5).  The logic for this should be consistent with what it does for the other cases.

I'm beginning to suspect that the problem isn't solely in the code, but rather the way the transformation is understood. The example outputs are not consistent enough for me to reliably extrapolate rules. To proceed, I need more examples of different inputs and their outputs to definitively define the transformation's logic.  More examples that cover edge cases and those with multiple red and blue pixels are crucial for a complete understanding.

Please provide more examples to help refine the solution.

**observations**



Given the inconsistencies in the previous examples and the resulting difficulties in creating a robust solution, I need more examples to accurately determine the transformation rules.  The current code attempts to address the 2x2 block placement, but the underlying rule itself remains unclear due to the inconsistencies in the provided examples.  

To proceed, I request additional examples that showcase various arrangements of blue (1) and red (2) pixels, including scenarios with multiple instances of these colors near each other and close to the grid's boundaries.  Examples with different grid sizes would also be helpful.  The more varied and comprehensive the examples, the higher the accuracy of the resulting algorithm.  Please provide at least five more examples with clear input and output grids.



**initialize the working output grid:**



function_call:



initialize_output_from_input



result:



initialize_output_from_input()
