The current state of the ``transform_grid`` function is still incomplete and inaccurate due to the inconsistencies and insufficient data from the examples provided previously.  The function attempts to place 2x2 blocks of yellow (4) and orange (7) around red (2) and blue (1) pixels.  However, without a clear and consistent set of rules governing the placement of these blocks (particularly concerning edge cases and potential overlaps), the function cannot reliably produce correct outputs.  The function incorrectly assumes that the 2x2 blocks will always fit perfectly within the grid boundaries without overlapping each other.

Before proceeding with further modifications, I need more examples to understand the exact rules governing the transformation.  I also need clarification on several aspects of the transformation:


#. **Overlap Handling:** What happens when the 2x2 blocks would overlap?
#. **Edge Case Handling:**  How are blocks placed near the edges of the grid? Is it a "wrap-around" effect, or is there a different rule?
#. **Multiple Red/Blue Pixels:** What happens when multiple red or blue pixels are close together or overlapping?
#. **Color Interactions:** Do the rules change depending on the proximity of different colors (e.g., a red pixel near a blue pixel)?

The current working output grid is identical to the input grid. No transformations have been applied yet. To apply transformations, I need a clear set of rules derived from sufficient consistent examples.  I cannot proceed until I have a reliable understanding of the transformation rules.  Please provide more examples.
