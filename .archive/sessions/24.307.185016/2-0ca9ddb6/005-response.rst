Given the inconsistencies in the previous examples and the resulting difficulties in creating a robust solution, I need more examples to accurately determine the transformation rules.  The current code attempts to address the 2x2 block placement, but the underlying rule itself remains unclear due to the inconsistencies in the provided examples.  

To proceed, I request additional examples that showcase various arrangements of blue (1) and red (2) pixels, including scenarios with multiple instances of these colors near each other and close to the grid's boundaries.  Examples with different grid sizes would also be helpful.  The more varied and comprehensive the examples, the higher the accuracy of the resulting algorithm.  Please provide at least five more examples with clear input and output grids.
