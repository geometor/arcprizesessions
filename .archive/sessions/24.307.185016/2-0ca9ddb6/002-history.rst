Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue

     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,7), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  The yellow and orange are arranged symmetrically around the original red and blue pixels.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add yellow and orange blocks symmetrically around the existing red and blue pixels.  The pattern is not fully apparent in just one example, more examples are needed to confirm the precise rule.  The size and position of the added blocks is not immediately evident.

**Additional Questions:**

To fully understand the transformation, more examples are needed.  Specifically, I'd like to see examples that address the following:


#. 
   **Consistency of the pattern:** Does the pattern of adding yellow and orange blocks remain consistent when the initial red and blue pixels are in different locations?

#. 
   **Varying Initial Colors:** Are yellow and orange blocks added for other colors or only red and blue?

#. 
   **Grid Size:** What happens if the grid size changes, affecting the distance to the edges?

#. 
   **Multiple Red/Blue:** What happens if the input grid contains multiple red and/or blue pixels?  Do blocks appear around each one, and do these blocks overlap?

#. 
   **Obstruction:** What happens when the red or blue pixel is near or touching the edge of the grid?

Providing more examples will significantly aid in clarifying the transformation rules and formulating a robust solution.
