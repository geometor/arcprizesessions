       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)

       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,6), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (7,3), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.
     transformation:
       - The transformation adds yellow and orange blocks symmetrically around the existing red and blue pixels, similar to previous examples.  Magenta remains unchanged.

The pattern remains consistent across all three examples.  The algorithm appears to identify red and blue pixels.  Then, it adds a 2x2 block of yellow and orange pixels symmetrically around each of these target pixels. The placement of yellow and orange blocks seems to be based on the position of the target pixel relative to the grid's edges.  If placing a block would extend outside of the grid, it seems to "wrap around" to the opposite side.  Other colors remain unchanged.  This observation needs further testing with additional examples, especially ones with multiple red and blue pixels near edges or each other, and with differently sized grids.
