An isolated pixel is defined as a pixel with value 8 that has zero or one adjacent pixels (horizontally or vertically) also with value 8. Change the color of these isolated azure pixels to 1 (blue).\n\n**Code Verification (Conceptual):**  The following Python code demonstrates a conceptual approach to identifying and transforming isolated azure pixels.  It doesn't handle edge cases perfectly but provides a framework for a complete solution.  A robust solution would require more sophisticated image processing techniques to handle edge conditions and potential variations in object shapes more gracefully.\n\n\n"
