**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 41
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
         - size: 2, position: right-bottom, color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.  The changes are always adjacent to an existing 'azure' block.
     transformation:
       - It appears that one or more isolated pixels on the corners of the azure object are changed to blue.

My initial hypothesis is that the transformation involves identifying isolated pixels (pixels that are connected to other pixels of the same color only through a single connection) belonging to the largest connected component of the color 'azure' (value 8).  These isolated pixels are then changed to 'blue' (value 1).  Further examples are needed to validate this hypothesis and to determine if there are any other conditions or rules involved.

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three 'azure' pixels changed to 'blue'.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, isolated 'azure' pixels are changed to 'blue'.  The change appears independent of location.

The second example reinforces the hypothesis from example_1.  The transformation consistently changes isolated azure pixels (those with only one or zero adjacent azure neighbors) to blue.  There's no apparent pattern to *which* isolated pixels change other than they must be isolated.  The location and overall arrangement of the azure group doesn't seem to influence the transformation.  The number of pixels changed varies but maintains the rule.
