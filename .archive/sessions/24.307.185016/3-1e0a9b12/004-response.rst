The transformation rule appears to be a combination of two actions:


#. 
   **Clearing the upper rows:** The top rows of the output grid are always filled with zeros (white). The number of rows cleared varies depending on the input.  The number of rows cleared seems to be determined such that there is sufficient space in the remaining rows to accommodate all non-zero elements from the input while preserving their relative positions.

#. 
   **Compacting non-zero elements to the bottom-right:** The non-zero elements from the input grid are moved to the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another.  This creates a compact block of non-zero values.

Let's analyze the number of cleared rows in each example:


* **Example 1:** 2 rows cleared (4x4 input, 2x4 output with non-zero elements).
* **Example 2:** 4 rows cleared (6x6 input, 2x6 output with non-zero elements).
* **Example 3:** 2 rows cleared (5x5 input, 3x5 output with non-zero elements).

There isn't a simple mathematical relationship directly observable between the input dimensions and the number of cleared rows. Further investigation with more examples might reveal a more precise pattern or rule. The key is maintaining relative positions of non-zero elements while ensuring they fit into the bottom-right section of the output grid.
