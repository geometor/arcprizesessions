     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 2: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 8: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x1, position: top-left, color: red (2)
         - size: 3x1, position: center-left, color: green (3)
         - size: 3x1, position: top-right, color: azure (8)

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 6: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 9: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x1, position: top-left, color: magenta (6)
         - size: 3x1, position: center-left, color: yellow (4)
         - size: 3x1, position: top-right, color: maroon (9)

     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. The transformation appears to be a more complex mapping than a simple addition.
     transformation:
       - The transformation is not a simple addition.  It appears to be a more complex mapping.  Let's investigate if there's a consistent pattern.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The initial hypothesis of simple addition (+3) is incorrect.  The transformation is more complex and doesn't involve a simple arithmetic operation on the color values. A more thorough analysis is needed to determine the underlying rule.  It might involve a lookup table or a more sophisticated mapping function.  Additional examples would be helpful to confirm this.
