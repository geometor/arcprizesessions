The output shows a pattern of red cells related to the presence of blue/grey cells in the input. The relationship isn't immediately clear, requiring more examples.\n```\n\n**Updated Thoughts and Questions:**\n\nAll three examples exhibit the same pattern:\n\n1.  **Size Reduction:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (always 3x3).\n2.  **Central Importance:** The column containing the value `5` in the input seems crucial.\n3.  **Color Change:** Output colors are predominantly white (`0`), with red (`2`) appearing in specific locations.\n4. **Red Cell Placement:** The placement of red cells in the output seems to be related to the distribution of blue (`1`) cells around the `5` in the input.  But the exact relationship remains undefined.  A systematic analysis of the input grid's configuration around the `5` is required.\n\nTo understand the transformation, I propose a more detailed analysis of the adjacency of non-zero values in the input around the `5`, focusing on how these patterns translate into the placement of red cells in the output. More examples, especially with variations in the distribution of `1` cells around the central `5`, are critically needed to define the transformation rule with certainty.  The lack of other colors in the examples leaves this aspect rather undefined.  It seems we are only interested in the values `0` and `1` in the input, and the value `5` only serves as a center-point.\n"
