**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 12
         - 1: 5
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue, description: a large blue block spanning the height with some gaps
         - size: 1x1, position: 3,3, color: grey, description: a single grey cell

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red, description: a single red cell in the center

     differences:
       cells_changed: 21
       colors_changed: Input colors completely replaced with fewer colors in the output.  The output is significantly smaller than the input.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to reduce the size and complexity of the image significantly.  It seems to only preserve a central cell if it has a value of 5 in the input.  The color of the central cell in the output is different from the input. The specific rules for the reduction in size and selection of the single central cell are unclear.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The output is much smaller than the input and seems to extract only a single cell from the input grid.  The location of the single cell and its color in the output appear to be related, but not directly, to features in the input.  Further examples are needed to establish consistent patterns and define the transformation rules accurately.  We need to determine how the size of the output is chosen, what specific conditions cause a cell to be preserved, and how its color changes.
