**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 12
         - 1: 5
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue, description: a large blue block spanning the height with some gaps
         - size: 1x1, position: 3,3, color: grey, description: a single grey cell

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red, description: a single red cell in the center

     differences:
       cells_changed: 21
       colors_changed: Input colors completely replaced with fewer colors in the output.  The output is significantly smaller than the input.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to reduce the size and complexity of the image significantly.  It seems to only preserve a central cell if it has a value of 5 in the input.  The color of the central cell in the output is different from the input. The specific rules for the reduction in size and selection of the single central cell are unclear.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The output is much smaller than the input and seems to extract only a single cell from the input grid.  The location of the single cell and its color in the output appear to be related, but not directly, to features in the input.  Further examples are needed to establish consistent patterns and define the transformation rules accurately.  We need to determine how the size of the output is chosen, what specific conditions cause a cell to be preserved, and how its color changes.



**example_2**



**input**



.. code-block::

    [[1 1 0 5 0 1 0]
     [0 0 1 5 1 1 1]
     [1 1 0 5 0 1 0]]


.. image:: _images/001-example_2_input.png
   :alt: _images/001-example_2_input.png



**output**



.. code-block::

    [[0 2 0]
     [0 0 2]
     [0 2 0]]

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 10
         - 1: 7
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue, description: a large blue block spanning the height with some gaps
         - size: 1x1, position: 3,1, color: grey, description: a single grey cell in the center column

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 6
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: red, description: a cross pattern of three red cells

     differences:
       cells_changed: 21
       colors_changed: Input colors replaced with fewer colors. Output is smaller than input, and contains a pattern of red cells.
     transformation:
       - Similar size reduction as example_1.  The central column in the input seems to be important.  The output shows a pattern of red cells related to the presence of blue/grey cells in the input.  The relationship isn't immediately clear, requiring more examples.

**Updated Thoughts and Questions:**

Example 2 provides more information, but the transformation remains elusive.  Both examples show a drastic size reduction, suggesting the output's dimensions are not directly related to the input's.  The presence of the value ``5`` in the input seems significant, potentially marking a central region for transformation.  The output colors are consistently 0 and 2 (white and red), regardless of the input colors.  

The patterns formed in the output suggest some kind of spatial relationship with the input, possibly relating to adjacency or specific configurations of colors around the central region marked by the value ``5``.  More examples are crucial to definitively determine the rules governing the size reduction, cell selection, and color assignment in the output.  Specifically, I need examples that vary the positioning of the ``5`` and the surrounding colors to understand the spatial aspect of this transformation.



**example_3**



**input**



.. code-block::

     [1 1 0 5 1 0 1]
     [0 1 1 5 1 0 1]]

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 10
         - 1: 7
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue, description: a large block spanning the height with some gaps
         - size: 1x1, position: 3,1, color: grey, description: a single grey cell in the center column

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 2
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,0, color: red, description: a red cell at the left
         - size: 1x1, position: 2,2, color: red, description: a red cell at the right bottom

     differences:
       cells_changed: 21
       colors_changed: Input colors replaced with fewer colors. Output is smaller than input, and contains a pattern of red cells.
     transformation:
       - Similar size reduction as example_1 and example_2. The central column in the input seems to be important. The output shows a pattern of red cells related to the presence of blue/grey cells in the input. The relationship isn't immediately clear, requiring more examples.

**Updated Thoughts and Questions:**

All three examples exhibit the same pattern:


#. **Size Reduction:** The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (always 3x3).
#. **Central Importance:** The column containing the value ``5`` in the input seems crucial.
#. **Color Change:** Output colors are predominantly white (\ ``0``\ ), with red (\ ``2``\ ) appearing in specific locations.
#. **Red Cell Placement:** The placement of red cells in the output seems to be related to the distribution of blue (\ ``1``\ ) cells around the ``5`` in the input.  But the exact relationship remains undefined.  A systematic analysis of the input grid's configuration around the ``5`` is required.

To understand the transformation, I propose a more detailed analysis of the adjacency of non-zero values in the input around the ``5``\ , focusing on how these patterns translate into the placement of red cells in the output. More examples, especially with variations in the distribution of ``1`` cells around the central ``5``\ , are critically needed to define the transformation rule with certainty.  The lack of other colors in the examples leaves this aspect rather undefined.  It seems we are only interested in the values ``0`` and ``1`` in the input, and the value ``5`` only serves as a center-point.
