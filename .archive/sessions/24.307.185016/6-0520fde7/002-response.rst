   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 10
         - 1: 7
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue, description: a large blue block spanning the height with some gaps
         - size: 1x1, position: 3,1, color: grey, description: a single grey cell in the center column

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 6
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: red, description: a cross pattern of three red cells

     differences:
       cells_changed: 21
       colors_changed: Input colors replaced with fewer colors. Output is smaller than input, and contains a pattern of red cells.
     transformation:
       - Similar size reduction as example_1.  The central column in the input seems to be important.  The output shows a pattern of red cells related to the presence of blue/grey cells in the input.  The relationship isn't immediately clear, requiring more examples.

**Updated Thoughts and Questions:**

Example 2 provides more information, but the transformation remains elusive.  Both examples show a drastic size reduction, suggesting the output's dimensions are not directly related to the input's.  The presence of the value ``5`` in the input seems significant, potentially marking a central region for transformation.  The output colors are consistently 0 and 2 (white and red), regardless of the input colors.  

The patterns formed in the output suggest some kind of spatial relationship with the input, possibly relating to adjacency or specific configurations of colors around the central region marked by the value ``5``.  More examples are crucial to definitively determine the rules governing the size reduction, cell selection, and color assignment in the output.  Specifically, I need examples that vary the positioning of the ``5`` and the surrounding colors to understand the spatial aspect of this transformation.
