     input:
       width: 9
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 62
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 6x5, position: (1,1), color: gray
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 60
         - 2: 6
         - 8: 10
       objects:
         - size: 6x5, position: (1,1), color: a mix of red and azure.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced with a pattern of azure and red. The pattern mirrors the original gray shape, with the edge pixels changed to azure (8) and the interior pixels changed to red (2).
     transformation:
       - Similar to examples 1 and 2, the gray object is transformed. The outer layer of the gray object becomes azure, and the inner layer becomes red. The overall shape is maintained.

**Final Refined Thoughts and Pattern Recognition:**

The consistent pattern across all three examples strongly supports the hypothesis that the transformation rule involves:


#. **Object Identification:** Identifying connected components of gray pixels (value 5).
#. **Layer Classification:** Distinguishing between outer and inner pixels within each component.  An outer pixel is defined as a pixel that has at least one adjacent white (0) pixel. All other pixels are inner pixels.
#. **Color Mapping:**  Replacing outer pixels with azure (8) and inner pixels with red (2).

This rule appears robust and accounts for variations in the shape and size of the gray objects.  There's no indication that the size or connectivity of the gray components affect the transformation.  We can move forward with high confidence in this rule to solve the test case.
