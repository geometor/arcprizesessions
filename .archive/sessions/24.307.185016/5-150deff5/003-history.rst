**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 6x6, position: (2,2), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 76
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 8
       objects:
         - size: 6x6, position: (2,2), color: a mix of azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced with a pattern of azure and red.  The pattern mirrors the original gray shape, with the edge pixels changed to azure (8) and the interior pixels changed to red (2).
     transformation:
       - The gray object is transformed.  The outer layer of the gray object becomes azure, and the inner layer becomes red.  The overall shape is maintained.

**Initial Thoughts and Pattern Recognition:**

The transformation involves a replacement of the gray (5) pixels with a pattern of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The core structure of the gray shape is preserved. The outer layer of the gray object changes to azure and the inner layer of the gray object changes to red. This suggests a rule based on the position of the gray pixels within the object.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and rule out alternative possibilities.

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 62
         - 5: 18
       objects:
         - size: 7x6, position: (1,1), color: gray
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 54
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 10
       objects:
         - size: 7x6, position: (1,1), color: a mix of azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced with a pattern of azure and red. The pattern mirrors the original gray shape, with the edge pixels changed to azure (8) and the interior pixels changed to red (2).
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, the gray object is transformed. The outer layer of the gray object becomes azure, and the inner layer becomes red. The overall shape is maintained.

**Revised Thoughts and Pattern Recognition:**

The pattern observed in both examples strongly suggests a transformation rule:


#. 
   **Identify Gray Objects:**  The algorithm first identifies contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels.  These regions form the objects of interest.

#. 
   **Outer and Inner Layers:** It then distinguishes between the "outer layer" (edge pixels) and "inner layer" (interior pixels) of each gray object.

#. 
   **Color Replacement:**  Outer layer pixels are replaced with azure (8), and inner layer pixels are replaced with red (2).

#. 
   **Shape Preservation:** The overall shape and size of the gray objects are maintained.

This rule seems consistent across both examples.  Further examples would help to refine this hypothesis and determine if edge cases or variations exist.  For instance, what happens with very small gray objects (1x1 or 2x2)? What about more complex shapes with internal cavities or irregular boundaries?
