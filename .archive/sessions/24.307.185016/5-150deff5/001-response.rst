Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 6x6, position: (2,2), color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 76
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 8
       objects:
         - size: 6x6, position: (2,2), color: a mix of azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced with a pattern of azure and red.  The pattern mirrors the original gray shape, with the edge pixels changed to azure (8) and the interior pixels changed to red (2).
     transformation:
       - The gray object is transformed.  The outer layer of the gray object becomes azure, and the inner layer becomes red.  The overall shape is maintained.

**Initial Thoughts and Pattern Recognition:**

The transformation involves a replacement of the gray (5) pixels with a pattern of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The core structure of the gray shape is preserved. The outer layer of the gray object changes to azure and the inner layer of the gray object changes to red. This suggests a rule based on the position of the gray pixels within the object.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and rule out alternative possibilities.
