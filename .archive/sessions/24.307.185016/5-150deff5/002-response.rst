   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 62
         - 5: 18
       objects:
         - size: 7x6, position: (1,1), color: gray
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 54
         - 8: 8
         - 2: 10
       objects:
         - size: 7x6, position: (1,1), color: a mix of azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced with a pattern of azure and red. The pattern mirrors the original gray shape, with the edge pixels changed to azure (8) and the interior pixels changed to red (2).
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, the gray object is transformed. The outer layer of the gray object becomes azure, and the inner layer becomes red. The overall shape is maintained.

**Revised Thoughts and Pattern Recognition:**

The pattern observed in both examples strongly suggests a transformation rule:


#. 
   **Identify Gray Objects:**  The algorithm first identifies contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels.  These regions form the objects of interest.

#. 
   **Outer and Inner Layers:** It then distinguishes between the "outer layer" (edge pixels) and "inner layer" (interior pixels) of each gray object.

#. 
   **Color Replacement:**  Outer layer pixels are replaced with azure (8), and inner layer pixels are replaced with red (2).

#. 
   **Shape Preservation:** The overall shape and size of the gray objects are maintained.

This rule seems consistent across both examples.  Further examples would help to refine this hypothesis and determine if edge cases or variations exist.  For instance, what happens with very small gray objects (1x1 or 2x2)? What about more complex shapes with internal cavities or irregular boundaries?
