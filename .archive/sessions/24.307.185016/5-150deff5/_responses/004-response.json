            "text": "The transformation consistently involves replacing gray (5) pixels with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining the original shape.  The rule is:\n\n1. **Identify Gray Objects:** Find all connected components of gray pixels.\n\n2. **Classify Pixels:**  Each gray pixel is classified as either an *outer* pixel (adjacent to at least one white pixel) or an *inner* pixel (not adjacent to any white pixels).\n\n3. **Color Replacement:** Outer pixels become azure (8), inner pixels become red (2).\n\nThis rule is demonstrated across all three examples, regardless of the size or complexity of the gray shapes.  No exceptions or edge cases were observed.  Therefore, this is a strong and likely complete description of the transformation.\n"
