The input grid is a 3x7 grid, primarily composed of white (0) and blue (1) pixels, with a central column of gray (5) pixels. The blue pixels are somewhat clustered but not forming a clear shape. The output grid is a 3x3 grid, mainly white (0), with two red (2) pixels located in the corners of the left and bottom-right.

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 10
       - 1: 7
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: varies, position: scattered, color: blue
       - size: 3x1, position: center, color: gray

   output:
     width: 3

     colors:
       - 0: 7
       - 2: 2
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: top-left and bottom-right, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: Gray (5) and some white (0) pixels are replaced by red (2), other pixels become white (0).

   transformation:
     - The input grid is reduced in size to 3x3.
     - The central gray column appears to influence the placement of red pixels in the corners of the output grid.
     - The remaining pixels in the output become white.

The transformation continues to show a relationship between the central gray column and the output. However, the placement of the red pixels in this example differs from the previous ones, suggesting a more nuanced relationship that may depend on the distribution of other colors (blue in this case) in the input grid.  More examples are needed to establish this relationship with more certainty.
