The current hypothesis suggests a relationship between the number of blue pixels adjacent to the central gray column and the number of red pixels in the output. Let's investigate further using code.

``code_execution``

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]])

   # Function to count adjacent blue pixels
   def count_adjacent_blues(grid):
       height, width = grid.shape
       adjacent_blues = 0
       central_column_index = width // 2
       for i in range(height):
           if i > 0 and grid[i - 1, central_column_index -1] == 1:
               adjacent_blues += 1
           if i < height - 1 and grid[i + 1, central_column_index -1] == 1:
               adjacent_blues += 1
           if grid[i, central_column_index + 1] == 1:
               adjacent_blues += 1
       return adjacent_blues


   adjacent_blues = count_adjacent_blues(test_input)
   print(f"Number of adjacent blue pixels: {adjacent_blues}")

   # Analyze the relationship between adjacent blues and red pixels in previous examples

   example1_input = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                             [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                             [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])
   example1_adjacent_blues = count_adjacent_blues(example1_input)

   example2_input = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                             [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                             [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]])
   example2_adjacent_blues = count_adjacent_blues(example2_input)

   example3_input = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                             [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                             [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])
   example3_adjacent_blues = count_adjacent_blues(example3_input)

   examples = {
       1: {"adjacent_blues": example1_adjacent_blues, "red_pixels": 1},
       2: {"adjacent_blues": example2_adjacent_blues, "red_pixels": 3},
       3: {"adjacent_blues": example3_adjacent_blues, "red_pixels": 2}
   }

   print("Examples Analysis:")
   for example_num, data in examples.items():
       print(f"Example {example_num}: Adjacent Blues = {data['adjacent_blues']}, Red Pixels = {data['red_pixels']}")

   test_red_pixels = 0
   if adjacent_blues > 0:
       #Trying a simple linear relationship. More sophisticated analysis is needed if this does not provide good results.
       test_red_pixels = int(adjacent_blues / 2.5) #Trying to adjust the scale empirically.
       if test_red_pixels == 0:
           test_red_pixels = 1

   print(f"Predicted number of red pixels for test input: {test_red_pixels}")

``code_execution_result``

.. code-block::

   Number of adjacent blue pixels: 8
   Examples Analysis:
   Example 1: Adjacent Blues = 4, Red Pixels = 1
   Example 2: Adjacent Blues = 6, Red Pixels = 3
   Example 3: Adjacent Blues = 6, Red Pixels = 2
   Predicted number of red pixels for test input: 3

The analysis reveals a potential relationship: more adjacent blue pixels correlate with a larger number of red pixels in the output. However, the relationship isn't strictly linear.  A more complex function might be needed.  In this case, a simple linear approximation suggests 3 red pixels for the test case.

Based on this, and trying to maintain some symmetry, a possible output would be:

.. code-block::

   [[0, 2, 0],
    [2, 0, 2],
    [0, 2, 0]]

This is still a guess, and the actual relationship between adjacent blue pixels and red pixel placement requires further investigation with more examples.  The linear approximation method used in the code may need improvement.  A more sophisticated function or machine learning approach may provide better results if more examples are provided.
