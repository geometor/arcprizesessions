**observations**


    


    

The input grid is a 3x7 grid containing blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The blue pixels form a loose vertical grouping, and the gray pixels are centered horizontally.  The output grid is a 3x3 grid, predominantly white (0) with a single red (2) pixel in the center.

The transformation appears to involve a significant size reduction and a change in the dominant color. The central gray column in the input seems to be related to the central red pixel in the output.  It's unclear what role, if any, the blue pixels play.


    


    

code_execution:


    


    

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                         [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Input Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)
   print("Input Grid Unique Values:", np.unique(input_grid))
   print("Output Grid Unique Values:", np.unique(output_grid))
   print("Input Grid Count of each color:")
   for i in np.unique(input_grid):
     print(f"{i}: {np.count_nonzero(input_grid == i)}")
   print("Output Grid Count of each color:")
   for i in np.unique(output_grid):
     print(f"{i}: {np.count_nonzero(output_grid == i)}")

.. code-block::

   Input Grid Shape: (3, 7)
   Output Grid Shape: (3, 3)
   Input Grid Unique Values: [0 1 5]
   Output Grid Unique Values: [0 2]
   Input Grid Count of each color:
   0: 11
   1: 7
   5: 3
   Output Grid Count of each color:
   0: 8
   2: 1


    


    

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 11
       - 1: 7
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: 7x1, position: center, color: gray
       - size: varies, position: left and right, color: blue

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 2: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: center, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: Gray (5) is replaced by red (2), others become white (0)

   transformation:
     - The input grid is reduced in size.
     - The central column of gray pixels becomes a single red pixel in the center of the output.
     - All other pixels become white.

Based on the analysis, a possible natural language program for the transformation could be:


#. **Reduce the size:** Shrink the input grid to 3x3.
#. **Identify the central column:** Locate the column of pixels that is in the middle of the input grid.
#. **Replace the central element:** Replace the central pixel from the central column with a red pixel.
#. **Set other pixels to white:** Set all other pixels in the resulting 3x3 grid to white.

This program appears to accurately describe the observed transformation.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to handle potential variations or edge cases.

INSTRUCTIONS:


    


    


* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
