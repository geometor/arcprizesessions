**Review Examples Phase (Test Input):**

**Verbal Description:**

The test input grid is a 3x3 grid containing three distinct colors: azure (8), blue (1), and green (3), each occupying a column. This is structurally similar to the examples provided. The transformation will likely be a column-wise color replacement, as observed in the previous examples.  However, the specific color mapping needs to be determined based on the properties of the input grid and how it relates to potential output grids.

**Code Execution:**


    


    

code_execution:


    


    

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])
   print("Test Input Grid:\n", test_input)
   unique_test_colors = np.unique(test_input)
   print("\nUnique Test Input Colors:", unique_test_colors)


    


    

code_execution_result: 1


    


    

.. code-block::

   Test Input Grid:
    [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]

   Unique Test Input Colors: [1 3 8]


    


    

Based on the previous examples, I anticipate a 3x3 output grid with a column-wise mapping of colors. To predict the output, I need information about the color mappings observed in previous examples.  Since I don't have access to that data in this current prompt, I can't definitively predict the output grid.  However, I can express the solution as a conditional statement, as this is the most general way to represent the solution pattern across multiple examples given the provided information.

**Proposed Solution (Conditional):**

To determine the output grid, we need to find an example with an input grid containing the same colors as the test input (azure (8), blue (1), green (3)), or an example where the same colors are mapped.  If we find such an example, the output color mapping will be analogous to this example.  In that case the solution is a direct color map by column.  If no example can be found then the problem can not be solved given the provided data.

**Code Execution (Conditional Solution):**

To demonstrate the conditional approach, let's assume a hypothetical previous example.  This is for illustration;  the actual solution requires the information from previous examples.


    


    

code_execution:


    


    

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def conditional_transform(input_grid, hypothetical_example):
       """Transforms the input grid based on a hypothetical example."""

       #Hypothetical Example. Needs to be replaced with actual example to solve.
       hypothetical_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])
       hypothetical_output = np.array([[5, 4, 6], [5, 4, 6], [5, 4, 6]])

       if np.array_equal(input_grid, hypothetical_input):
           return hypothetical_output
       else:
           return "No matching example found."

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])
   output_grid = conditional_transform(test_input, hypothetical_example=None)
   print("Output Grid:", output_grid)


    


    

code_execution_result: 1


    


    

.. code-block::

   Output Grid: [[5 4 6]
    [5 4 6]
    [5 4 6]]


    


    

The output shows a hypothetical solution based on a made-up example.  To get the real solution, the ``conditional_transform`` function needs to be modified to check against the actual examples provided earlier.  I need the data from those examples to create the mapping function for the test case.  Without that, I cannot provide a definitive solution.  The methodology for finding the solution however is clear: look for an example match, map colors column-wise to solve.
