This is structurally similar to the examples provided. The transformation will likely be a column-wise color replacement, as observed in the previous examples.  However, the specific color mapping needs to be determined based on the properties of the input grid and how it relates to potential output grids.\n\n\n**Code Execution:**\n\n"

To predict the output, I need information about the color mappings observed in previous examples.  Since I don't have access to that data in this current prompt, I can't definitively predict the output grid.  However, I can express the solution as a conditional statement, as this is the most general way to represent the solution pattern across multiple examples given the provided information.\n\n\n**Proposed Solution (Conditional):**\n\nTo determine the output grid, we need to find an example with an input grid containing the same colors as the test input (azure (8), blue (1), green (3)), or an example where the same colors are mapped.  If we find such an example, the output color mapping will be analogous to this example.  In that case the solution is a direct color map by column.  If no example can be found then the problem can not be solved given the provided data.\n\n**Code Execution (Conditional Solution):**\n\nTo demonstrate the conditional approach, let's assume a hypothetical previous example.  This is for illustration;  the actual solution requires the information from previous examples.\n\n"
