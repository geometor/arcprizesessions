**Review Examples Phase**

**Verbal Description:**

The input grid is a 3x3 grid with maroon (9), yellow (4), and red (2) arranged in columns. The output grid is a 3x3 grid with azure (8), green (3), and magenta (6) arranged in columns. The transformation is again a column-wise replacement of colors, with a unique mapping for this example.

**Code Execution:**


    


    

code_execution:


    


    

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]])
   output_grid = np.array([[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   unique_input_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
   unique_output_colors = np.unique(output_grid)

   print("\nUnique Input Colors:", unique_input_colors)
   print("Unique Output Colors:", unique_output_colors)

   # Attempting column-wise mapping
   color_mapping = {}
   for i in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
       color_mapping[input_grid[0, i]] = output_grid[0, i]

   print("\nColor Mapping:", color_mapping)

   transformed_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
   for i in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
       transformed_grid[:, i] = color_mapping[input_grid[0, i]]

   print("\nTransformed Grid:\n", transformed_grid)
   print("\nAre the transformed and output grids identical?", np.array_equal(transformed_grid, output_grid))

.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[9 4 2]
    [9 4 2]
    [9 4 2]]

   Output Grid:
    [[8 3 6]
    [8 3 6]
    [8 3 6]]

   Unique Input Colors: [2 4 9]
   Unique Output Colors: [3 6 8]

   Color Mapping: {np.int64(9): np.int64(8), np.int64(4): np.int64(3), np.int64(2): np.int64(6)}

   Transformed Grid:
    [[8 3 6]
    [8 3 6]
    [8 3 6]]

   Are the transformed and output grids identical? True


    


    

**Findings and Natural Language Program:**

The code confirms the consistent pattern: column-wise color replacement with a unique mapping for each example.  The natural language program remains the same as before: "For each column in the input grid, replace the color with the corresponding color in the output grid. The correspondence between input and output colors is determined by the column index, and this mapping is specific to each example."

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 9: 3
       - 4: 3
       - 2: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: column 1, color: maroon
       - size: 3x1, position: column 2, color: yellow
       - size: 3x1, position: column 3, color: red

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 8: 3
       - 3: 3
       - 6: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: column 1, color: azure
       - size: 3x1, position: column 2, color: green
       - size: 3x1, position: column 3, color: magenta

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All colors changed, column-wise mapping.

   transformation:
     - Column-wise color replacement based on input color index. The mapping is specific to each example.

**Ruminate Phase**

From the four examples, we've learned that the transformation consistently involves a column-wise replacement of colors.  The mapping between input and output colors is unique to each example and is not based on a simple arithmetic or other easily discernible function.  The transformation appears to be a lookup table where the column index in the input determines the corresponding column in the output and the color within that column is replaced according to the specific mapping.

**Natural Language Program:**

"The transformation is a column-wise mapping.  For each column in the input grid, replace each instance of the color present in that column with the corresponding color in the output grid for that column. The mapping between input and output colors is unique for each example and must be determined from the provided input/output pair."

**Code Execution (Validation):**

The code used in the Review Examples phase effectively validates this natural language program.  A function could be written to generalize this, taking the input and output grids as arguments and returning the transformed grid. This function would identify the unique colors in each column of the input grid and construct the necessary column-wise mapping from the input and output grids.  Then it would apply this mapping to produce the transformed grid, which would then be compared to the provided output grid for verification.  For brevity I will not write this general function, but the code within each of the previous examples demonstrates its core logic.

**Pre-Test Phase and Test Phase:**  I need the test puzzle's input grid to proceed to the Pre-Test and Test phases.
