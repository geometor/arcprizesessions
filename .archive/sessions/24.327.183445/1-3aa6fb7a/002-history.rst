**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged roughly in an L shape. The output grid is identical to the input except that some of the azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel on their top or left side have been changed to blue.

   import numpy as np

   Changed pixel coordinates: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4))]
   Pixel at (1, 2): changed from 0 to 1

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1), color: azure - L shaped cluster

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
       - 1:2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1), color: azure - L shaped cluster with 2 blue pixels

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to a white pixel on the top or left are changed to blue.

The transformation appears to be a conditional replacement.  Azure pixels which are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a white pixel on their top or left become blue.  Other azure pixels remain unchanged.

INSTRUCTIONS:


    


    


* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
