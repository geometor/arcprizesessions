The working output grid is initialized to the input grid.  The transformation rule, as determined from the examples, is to change azure (8) pixels to blue (1) if they have a white (0) pixel immediately to their top or left.  Let's verify this with code.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8:
                   if r > 0 and grid[r - 1, c] == 0 or c > 0 and grid[r, c - 1] == 0:
                       new_grid[r, c] = 1
       return new_grid

   output_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)
   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   changed_pixels = list(zip(diff[0], diff[1]))
   print("\nChanged pixel coordinates:", changed_pixels)

   for r, c in changed_pixels:
     print(f"Pixel at ({r}, {c}): changed from {input_grid[r,c]} to {output_grid[r,c]}")

.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Changed pixel coordinates: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(5)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(1), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(3), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(1)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(0))]
   Pixel at (0, 5): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (1, 0): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (1, 1): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (1, 6): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (3, 3): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (4, 3): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (4, 4): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (5, 1): changed from 8 to 1
   Pixel at (6, 0): changed from 8 to 1

The code correctly applies the transformation rule. The output grid accurately reflects the changes according to the rule.  All azure pixels with a white pixel to their top or left have been changed to blue.
