For each distinct azure (8) object in the input grid, a new blue (1) pixel is inserted in two potential locations:\n\n1. **Right:** Immediately to the right of the top-left-most azure (8) pixel of the object.\n2. **Down:** Immediately below the top-left-most azure (8) pixel of the object.\n\nHowever, there's a condition: if either of these potential locations is already occupied by another azure (8) pixel (belonging to the same or a different object), the blue (1) pixel is *not* inserted in that location.\n\nEffectively, a new blue (1) object, always of size one, acts as a diagonal neighbor to the top-left corner of an azure object if possible.\n"
