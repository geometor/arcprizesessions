   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
   objects:
     - three distinct azure (8) objects. Two are composed of two pixels and one of three pixels.

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 1: 3
       - 8: 6
   objects:
     - same objects as input
     - three new objects made of blue pixels (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: three cells changed from white (0) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - For each azure (8) object insert a new blue (1) object in an empty cell immediately to the right and down from its top left pixel.  If there is an azure (8) object in the place where blue should be placed, it's skipped (bottom right corner for all the objects).



**examples summary**



The transformation observed in both examples follows a consistent pattern.  For each distinct azure (8) object in the input grid, a new blue (1) pixel is inserted in two potential locations:


#. **Right:** Immediately to the right of the top-left-most azure (8) pixel of the object.
#. **Down:** Immediately below the top-left-most azure (8) pixel of the object.

However, there's a condition: if either of these potential locations is already occupied by another azure (8) pixel (belonging to the same or a different object), the blue (1) pixel is *not* inserted in that location.

Effectively, a new blue (1) object, always of size one, acts as a diagonal neighbor to the top-left corner of an azure object if possible.

Based on the predicted output, the following actions should be performed:


#. **Initialize output from input:** This will create the base grid.
#. **Set pixel (1,5) to 1 (blue):** This adds the blue pixel next to the top-right azure object.
#. **Set pixel (3,4) to 1 (blue):** This adds the blue pixel next to the object spanning (3,3) and (4,3).
#. **Set pixel (5,2) to 1 (blue):** This adds the blue pixel next to the single azure pixel at (5,1).

After these steps, the output grid should match the predicted output, completing the puzzle.  Submit the result.
