002 â€¢ Response
==============


.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
   objects:
     - three distinct azure (8) objects. Two are composed of two pixels and one of three pixels.

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 1: 3
       - 8: 6
   objects:
     - same objects as input
     - three new objects made of blue pixels (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: three cells changed from white (0) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - For each azure (8) object insert a new blue (1) object in an empty cell immediately to the right and down from its top left pixel.  If there is an azure (8) object in the place where blue should be placed, it's skipped (bottom right corner for all the objects).
