The outer portion of the original object becomes azure (8), while the concave or missing portions are filled with red (2).\n\n2. **Preservation of Overall Shape:** While the original object is split and re-colored, the overall shape or outline of the original object is generally preserved in the output, formed by the combination of azure (8) and red (2) objects.  The azure (8) object can be seen as the original object with a \"piece\" removed, and the red (2) object is that missing piece.\n\nLet's use `numpy` to verify some of these observations in code:\n\n"
