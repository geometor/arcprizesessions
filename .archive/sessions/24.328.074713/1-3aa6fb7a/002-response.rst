The input grid in example 2 shows a scattered cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, but three azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  These changed pixels appear to be located at the lower-right, lower-left and upper-right edges of the azure cluster.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at row indices: {diff[0]}, column indices: {diff[1]}")
   print(f"Input values at difference locations: {input_grid[diff]}")
   print(f"Output values at difference locations: {output_grid[diff]}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Differences found at row indices: [1 2 5], column indices: [4 3 3]
   Input values at difference locations: [8 0 0]
   Output values at difference locations: [1 1 1]

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 7
     objects:
       - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 37
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Three azure pixels at the edges of the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The pattern seems to be related to the outer perimeter of the azure cluster.

The second example reinforces the observation that azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are changed to blue.  The change doesn't seem to be strictly about lower-right, but rather any pixels at the perimeter of the cluster.  More examples would help clarify the precise rule for selecting which perimeter pixels to change.
