**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is identical except for two changes.  A single azure pixel in the input has been changed to blue (1) in two different locations. The locations of the changes seem to be related to the overall position of the cluster of azure pixels in the input.

   transformation:
     - Two azure pixels near the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The specific location of the changed pixels appears to be relative to the overall position and shape of the azure cluster.

My analysis of the example shows that the transformation involves changing some azure pixels to blue pixels. The location of the changes seems dependent on the position of the azure cluster within the grid, with pixels on the "lower right" edge of the cluster being modified.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.

**observations**






The input grid in example 2 shows a scattered cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, but three azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  These changed pixels appear to be located at the lower-right, lower-left and upper-right edges of the azure cluster.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

     objects:
       - size: 4, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Three azure pixels at the edges of the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The pattern seems to be related to the outer perimeter of the azure cluster.

The second example reinforces the observation that azure pixels at the edges of the cluster are changed to blue.  The change doesn't seem to be strictly about lower-right, but rather any pixels at the perimeter of the cluster.  More examples would help clarify the precise rule for selecting which perimeter pixels to change.






**examples summary**






Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:  Identify all the azure (8) pixels.  Then, select a subset of these azure pixels that are located at the perimeter (edges) of the cluster of azure pixels.  Change these selected azure pixels to blue (1) pixels. The selection of which perimeter pixels to change isn't fully clear from just two examples; more data is needed to determine if there's a specific pattern or if the selection is somewhat arbitrary within the perimeter.

       #This part needs refinement based on more examples.  Currently, it arbitrarily selects perimeter pixels.

    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]]






The code above implements a *very* basic version of the transformation. The key problem is that the selection of which perimeter pixels to change to blue is not clearly defined by just two examples. The current implementation makes an arbitrary selection of a limited number of perimeter pixels.  To improve it, we need more examples showing how this selection is made.  Are there specific corners or edges that are always prioritized?  Is there a relationship between the size/shape of the azure cluster and the number or location of changed pixels?  More examples are crucial to develop a robust algorithm.  The ``is_perimeter`` check is also very simplistic, and will need to be more sophisticated for clusters that are not rectangular.

In summary, while the current code captures the general concept of changing perimeter azure pixels to blue, it is far from a complete and accurate representation of the transformation rule.  More data is needed to build a more robust algorithm.
