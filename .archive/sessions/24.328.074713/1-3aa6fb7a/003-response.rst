Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:  Identify all the azure (8) pixels.  Then, select a subset of these azure pixels that are located at the perimeter (edges) of the cluster of azure pixels.  Change these selected azure pixels to blue (1) pixels. The selection of which perimeter pixels to change isn't fully clear from just two examples; more data is needed to determine if there's a specific pattern or if the selection is somewhat arbitrary within the perimeter.

    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]]






The code above implements a *very* basic version of the transformation. The key problem is that the selection of which perimeter pixels to change to blue is not clearly defined by just two examples. The current implementation makes an arbitrary selection of a limited number of perimeter pixels.  To improve it, we need more examples showing how this selection is made.  Are there specific corners or edges that are always prioritized?  Is there a relationship between the size/shape of the azure cluster and the number or location of changed pixels?  More examples are crucial to develop a robust algorithm.  The ``is_perimeter`` check is also very simplistic, and will need to be more sophisticated for clusters that are not rectangular.

In summary, while the current code captures the general concept of changing perimeter azure pixels to blue, it is far from a complete and accurate representation of the transformation rule.  More data is needed to build a more robust algorithm.
