**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is identical except for two changes.  A single azure pixel in the input has been changed to blue (1) in two different locations. The locations of the changes seem to be related to the overall position of the cluster of azure pixels in the input.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at row indices: {diff[0]}, column indices: {diff[1]}")
   print(f"Input values at difference locations: {input_grid[diff]}")
   print(f"Output values at difference locations: {output_grid[diff]}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-right, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 5
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-right, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: center-right, color: blue


   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue pixels.
   transformation:
     - Two azure pixels near the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The specific location of the changed pixels appears to be relative to the overall position and shape of the azure cluster.

My analysis of the example shows that the transformation involves changing some azure pixels to blue pixels. The location of the changes seems dependent on the position of the azure cluster within the grid, with pixels on the "lower right" edge of the cluster being modified.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
   - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
  use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
  you findings in the output
  remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
