The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is identical except for two changes.  A single azure pixel in the input has been changed to blue (1) in two different locations. The locations of the changes seem to be related to the overall position of the cluster of azure pixels in the input.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-right, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 41
       - 8: 5
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-right, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: center-right, color: blue


   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue pixels.
   transformation:
     - Two azure pixels near the edge of the azure cluster are changed to blue.  The specific location of the changed pixels appears to be relative to the overall position and shape of the azure cluster.

My analysis of the example shows that the transformation involves changing some azure pixels to blue pixels. The location of the changes seems dependent on the position of the azure cluster within the grid, with pixels on the "lower right" edge of the cluster being modified.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.
