The input is a 6x6 grid with several colors scattered across the grid: yellow (4), orange (7), azure (8), and maroon (9) on a white (0) background. The output is also a 6x6 grid. The transformation appears to follow the same logic as the previous example: the non-zero elements in the input grid are consolidated at the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their left-to-right order. Elements that are already in the bottom row stay in their columns in the bottom row in the output, but get shifted down if needed to make space for moved elements.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                         [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
                         [4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
                           [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9]])

   print(f"Input grid:\n{input_grid}")
   print(f"Output grid:\n{output_grid}")

   input_indices = np.argwhere(input_grid != 0)
   output_indices = np.argwhere(output_grid != 0)

   print(f"Non-zero indices in input:\n{input_indices}")
   print(f"Non-zero indices in output:\n{output_indices}")

   input_colors, input_counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)
   output_colors, output_counts = np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True)

   Input grid:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 9]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [4 0 0 0 0 0]

   Output grid:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0]

    [4 0 0 0 0 0]
    [4 0 7 8 0 0]
    [4 0 7 8 0 9]]
   Non-zero indices in input:
   [[0 5]
    [1 3]
    [3 0]
    [4 0]
    [4 2]
    [4 3]
    [5 0]
    [5 2]]
   Non-zero indices in output:
   [[3 0]
    [4 0]
    [4 2]
    [4 3]
    [5 0]
    [5 2]

   Input Colors and Counts: {0: 28, 4: 3, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 1}
   Output Colors and Counts: {0: 28, 4: 3, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 1}

The code confirms that the non-zero elements are moved to the last row, preserving their left to right order. Elements that are in the last row in the input stay in their column but move down if necessary to make space for elements moved from other rows. The color counts remain unchanged. The 4,7,and 8 in rows 4 and 5 are fixed in place but moved down.

   differences:

     colors_changed: no
   transformation:
     - Move all non-zero cells to the bottom row.
     - Preserve the left-to-right order of the non-zero elements.
     - if a non-zero element is already in the bottom row it stays in it's column but moves down if necessary.

The transformation moves all non-zero pixels in the input grid to the bottom row of the output grid. The horizontal order of these pixels is preserved, starting from the left and proceeding to the right. Pixels that are already in the last row of the input grid stay in the last row but are shifted down if necessary to make room for non-zero elements moved from higher rows.
