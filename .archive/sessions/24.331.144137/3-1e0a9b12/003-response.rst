The input is a 5x5 grid containing several colors scattered throughout: blue (1), red (2), green (3), and magenta (6) on a white (0) background. The output is also a 5x5 grid. Once again, the transformation appears to move all the non-zero elements to the bottom row, maintaining their left-to-right order. The elements that are already in the last row in the input remain there but are shifted down if necessary to make space for other elements.

                         [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 3, 0, 1, 2],
                         [6, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 3, 0, 0, 0]])

   Input grid:
   [[0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 3 0 0 0]
    [0 3 0 1 2]
    [6 0 0 0 0]
    [0 3 0 0 0]]
   Output grid:
   [[0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 3 0 0 0]
    [0 3 0 1 0]
    [6 3 0 1 2]]
   Non-zero indices in input:
   [[0 3]
    [1 1]
    [2 1]
    [2 3]
    [2 4]
    [3 0]
    [4 1]]
   Non-zero indices in output:
   [[2 1]
    [3 1]
    [3 3]
    [4 0]
    [4 1]
    [4 3]
    [4 4]]
   Input Colors and Counts: {0: 18, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 3, 6: 1}
   Output Colors and Counts: {0: 18, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 3, 6: 1}

The code confirms the observations. Non-zero elements in the input grid are moved to the last row in the output grid, preserving their left-to-right order. If the non-zero elements are already in the last row, they stay in their same column in the output grid but move down as needed to make room for other elements moving into the last row. The color counts are preserved in the output. The 3 in row 2 column 1 stays in column one but is pushed down.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 6
     colors_changed: no
   transformation:
     - Move all non-zero cells to the bottom row.
     - Preserve the left-to-right order of the non-zero elements.
     - if a non-zero element is already in the bottom row it stays in it's column but moves down if necessary.

The transformation moves all non-zero pixels in the input grid to the bottom row of the output grid. The horizontal order of these pixels is preserved, starting from the left and proceeding to the right. Pixels that are already in the last row of the input grid stay in the last row in their original columns but are shifted down if necessary to make room for non-zero elements moved from higher rows.
