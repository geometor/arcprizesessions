**observations**






The input grid is a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming two L-shapes. One L-shape is in the upper left quadrant and the other in the lower right quadrant. The output grid is also a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background, and azure (8) pixels forming the same L-shapes as the input. However, one pixel in each L-shape has been changed from azure (8) to blue (1). Specifically, the pixel that is at the "elbow" of each "L" has been changed to blue.

#. **Locate Elbow Pixels:** For each L-shape, find the pixel at the "elbow" where the vertical and horizontal segments meet. In this case the elbow pixel is adjacent to two azure pixels, and shares an edge with the object, but is not itself part of the L.
#. **Change Elbow Color:** Change the color of each identified "elbow" pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).

**observations**






The input grid is a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming three L-shapes of different orientations. The output grid is also a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming the same L-shapes. However, one pixel in each L-shape has been changed from azure (8) to blue (1). Specifically, the "elbow" pixel of each L-shape has been changed.

     - Change the color of the "elbow" pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

The natural language program for the transformation is:


#. **Identify L-Shapes:** Find all L-shaped groups of azure (8) pixels.
#. **Locate Elbow Pixels:** For each L-shape, find the pixel at the "elbow" where the vertical and horizontal segments meet and which is not part of the L-shape itself but is adjacent to the elbow.
#. **Change Elbow Color:** Change the color of each identified "elbow" pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).






**examples summary**






Here's a summary of my observations from the provided examples to explain the transformation from input to output grids:

**Summary of Observations:**

In both examples, the input and output grids are 7x7. The grids primarily consist of a white (0) background with azure (8) pixels forming one or more L-shapes. The transformation involves identifying the "elbow" pixel of each L-shape and changing its color from azure (8) to blue (1). The elbow pixel is defined as the pixel that is immediately adjacent to the intersection of the horizontal and vertical arms of the L and which is not part of the L-shape itself. Importantly, the L shapes are always formed of 3 pixels in the examples.

**Natural Language Program:**


#. **Identify L-Shapes:** Locate all groups of azure (8) pixels that form an L-shape.
#. **Locate Elbow Pixels:** For each L-shape, find the "elbow" pixel. This is the pixel adjacent to the point where the horizontal and vertical arms of the L would intersect if extended, and which is not part of the L-shape.
#. **Change Elbow Color:** Change the color of the identified "elbow" pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

**Code Execution to Validate Transformation:**

I'll use the ``find_elbow_pixels`` function defined earlier to test this on both examples. Since the function has already been tested in the prior steps, I will just call it and display the results.

         if grid[r,c] == color:
           # Check for top-left L
           if grid[r-1, c] == color and grid[r, c-1] == color and grid[r-1, c-1] == 0:
               elbows.append((r,c-1))
           # Check for top-right L
           if grid[r-1, c] == color and grid[r, c+1] == color and grid[r-1,c+1] == 0:
               elbows.append((r,c+1))
           # Check for bottom-left L
           if grid[r+1, c] == color and grid[r, c-1] == color and grid[r+1,c-1] == 0:
              elbows.append((r,c-1))
           # Check for bottom-right L
           if grid[r+1,c] == color and grid[r,c+1] == color and grid[r+1,c+1] == 0:

   Elbow pixels in Example 2 input: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (5, 3)]

   Example 2 transformation check: True

**Review of Findings:**

The code execution confirms the natural language program. The ``find_elbow_pixels`` function correctly identifies the elbow pixels in both example input grids. The ``check_transformation`` function validates that the identified elbows are changed to blue (1) and that the remainder of the L shapes are preserved. With this I am confident that the natural language program accurately describes the transformation.

**initialize the working output grid:**






====






INSTRUCTIONS:






use function_call to initialize the working output grid:


* initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between
  input and output
* initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
