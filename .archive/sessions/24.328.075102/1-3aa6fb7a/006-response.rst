The working output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.  This is correct as the transformation only modifies certain pixels, not the entire grid.

The code correctly implements the transformation rule as confirmed by the previous tests, so I expect it to produce the correct output for this test case as well.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r,c] == 8:
                   adjacent_white = False
                   if r > 0 and grid[r-1, c] == 0:
                       adjacent_white = True
                   if r < rows -1 and grid[r+1, c] == 0:
                       adjacent_white = True
                   if c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 0:
                       adjacent_white = True
                   if c < cols -1 and grid[r, c+1] == 0:
                       adjacent_white = True

                   if adjacent_white:
                       new_grid[r,c] = 1

       return new_grid

   output_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   diff = input_grid - output_grid
   print("\nDifference:\n", diff)
   print("\nNumber of cells changed:", np.sum(diff != 0))

   #Find coordinates of changed cells
   changed_cells = np.where(diff != 0)
   print("\nCoordinates of changed cells:", list(zip(changed_cells[0], changed_cells[1])))

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Difference:
    [[ 0  0  0  0  0  7  0]
    [ 7  7  0  0  0  0  7]
    [ 7  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  7  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  7  7  0  0]
    [ 0  7  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 7  7  0  0  0  0  0]]

   Number of cells changed: 11

   Coordinates of changed cells: [(0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)]

The changes in the working output grid are consistent with the rule. The code correctly identifies and transforms the edge light blue pixels to blue pixels.  The number of cells changed (11) and their coordinates are also correctly reported by the code.
