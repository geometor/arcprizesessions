The input grid consists primarily of white (0) pixels with a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some of the azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.

   Locations where input and output differ:

   Row 3, Column 4: 0 changed to 1
   Row 6, Column 4: 0 changed to 1

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 9
     objects:
       - size: 9, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 9
       - 1:3
     objects:
       - size: 9, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels adjacent to white pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels change to blue.  The change seems related to adjacency to white pixels.

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous one.  Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.  The pattern appears to be that any azure pixel that has at least one adjacent white pixel is changed to blue.
