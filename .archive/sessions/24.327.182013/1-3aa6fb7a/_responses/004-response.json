            "text": "Here's a report following the instructions, incorporating code execution to investigate properties of the test input grid and applying the established transformation rule.\n\n**Review Examples Phase**\n\nWe've already completed this phase.  The analysis of example_1 and example_2 and the resulting transformation rule are described above. The natural language program is: \"Change any azure pixel that is orthogonally adjacent to at least one white pixel to blue.\"\n\n**Ruminate Phase**\n\nThe examples demonstrate a consistent pattern:  azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels are transformed into blue (1) pixels. The adjacency is orthogonal (horizontally or vertically). No diagonal adjacency affects the transformation.  The transformation is local; it only considers the immediate neighbors of each pixel.\n\n\nThe natural language program remains: \"Change any azure pixel that is orthogonally adjacent to at least one white pixel to blue.\"\n\nThe code to implement this transformation is presented in the Review Examples phase.\n\n**Pre-Test Phase**\n\nNo specific pre-test instructions were given.  We are ready to proceed to the Test Phase.\n\n**Test Phase**\n\n**Input Grid:**\n\n```\n[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n\nThe input grid contains a scattered pattern of azure (8) pixels surrounded by white (0) pixels.  Some azure pixels are adjacent to other azure pixels while others are directly adjacent to white pixels.\n\n**Code Execution:**\n\n"
