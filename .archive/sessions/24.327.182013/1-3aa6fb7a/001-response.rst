The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: center-left, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels adjacent to white pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels change to blue.  The change seems related to adjacency to white pixels.

The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it seems that azure pixels which are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to white (0) pixels are changed to blue.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
