**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.

       - size: 2, position: center-left, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels adjacent to white pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels change to blue.  The change seems related to adjacency to white pixels.

The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it seems that azure pixels which are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to white (0) pixels are changed to blue.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

**observations**


    


    

The input grid consists primarily of white (0) pixels with a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some of the azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.

                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

       - 0: 40
       - 8: 9
       - 1:3
     objects:
       - size: 9, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels adjacent to white pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels change to blue.  The change seems related to adjacency to white pixels.

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous one.  Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.  The pattern appears to be that any azure pixel that has at least one adjacent white pixel is changed to blue.

INSTRUCTIONS:


    


    


* summarize your observations to explain the transformation of the input to output
* use code_execution to investigate properties, patterns and differences in the grids
