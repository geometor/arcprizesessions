**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.


    


    

code_execution:


    


    

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = input_grid - output_grid
   print(f'{diff=}')
   print("Locations where input and output differ:")
   for row in range(diff.shape[0]):

               print(f"Row {row+1}, Column {col+1}: {input_grid[row, col]} changed to {output_grid[row, col]}")

          [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]])
   Locations where input and output differ:
   Row 2, Column 3: 0 changed to 1
   Row 5, Column 5: 0 changed to 1


    


    

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: center-left, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels adjacent to white pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels change to blue.  The change seems related to adjacency to white pixels.

The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, it seems that azure pixels which are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to white (0) pixels are changed to blue.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

INSTRUCTIONS:


    


    


* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
