I cannot proceed without additional information. My previous attempts have failed to correctly identify and implement the transformation rules for the provided test case due to a lack of sufficient and representative examples.  The modifications made to the working output grid (setting the first column to gray) do not align with the patterns observed in the initial examples.

The core issue is that the examples provided do not cover edge cases, especially those with interspersed zero rows within the blocks of non-zero rows.   I cannot infer the correct transformation rules from the provided examples alone.  I need either more examples or a clear description of the transformation rules to complete the puzzle.  Any further code execution at this point would be unproductive without a better understanding of the problem's underlying logic.
