The transformation consistently involves adding cross-shaped patterns around specific colors:


* 
  **Red (2) pixels:** A cross-shaped pattern of yellow (4) pixels is added. The size of the cross seems to adapt based on the proximity of other red pixels.  If only one red pixel exists, a 3x3 yellow cross is added. If more red pixels exist, the cross expands, although the exact scaling rule isn't perfectly clear from these examples.

* 
  **Blue (1) pixels:** A cross-shaped pattern of orange (7) pixels is added. Similar to the yellow cross, the size of the orange cross seems to depend on the proximity of other blue pixels. A 3x3 orange cross is added if only one blue pixel exists, otherwise, it expands.

* 
  **Other colors:** Pixels of colors other than red and blue remain unchanged.

The code executions confirmed the positions of the initial and added pixels, reinforcing the pattern described above.

A natural language program to describe this transformation could be:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       """Transforms the input grid according to the observed pattern."""
       output_grid = np.copy(grid)
       rows, cols = grid.shape

       red_positions = np.where(grid == 2)
       blue_positions = np.where(grid == 1)

       # Add yellow crosses around red pixels
       for r, c in zip(*red_positions):
           cross_size = 3 #Default Size
           if np.sum(grid == 2) > 1:
               cross_size = 5
           add_cross(output_grid, r, c, 4, cross_size)


       # Add orange crosses around blue pixels
       for r, c in zip(*blue_positions):
           cross_size = 3 #Default size
           if np.sum(grid == 1) > 1:
               cross_size = 5
           add_cross(output_grid, r, c, 7, cross_size)

       return output_grid

   def add_cross(grid, row, col, color, cross_size):
       """Adds a cross of the given color to the grid at the specified position."""
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       half_size = cross_size // 2

       for i in range(max(0, row - half_size), min(rows, row + half_size + 1)):
           grid[i, col] = color

       for j in range(max(0, col - half_size), min(cols, col + half_size + 1)):
           grid[row, j] = color

   #Example Usage
   example_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
