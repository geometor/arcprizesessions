The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels bordering white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  It seems like a rule of replacement based on adjacency.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences at indices: {diff}")

   azure_count_input = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 8)
   blue_count_output = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 1)
   print(f"Azure count in input: {azure_count_input}")
   print(f"Blue count in output: {blue_count_output}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-bottom, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
       - 1:2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-bottom, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: near azure, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.

The code shows that two cells changed from azure to blue.  The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of azure pixels that are adjacent to white pixels with blue pixels.  There is no apparent pattern other than this adjacency.
