The current ``working output grid`` is incorrect because it only reflects a partial application of the transformation rule.  The rule states that *all* azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels should change to blue (1). The current grid only shows one such change. The code, however, correctly identifies *all* such pixels (as shown in the previous code execution).  Therefore the problem is not in identifying the pixels to change but in updating the ``working output grid``.

Let's correct this by directly using the ``transform_grid`` function to generate the final output:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for i in range(rows):
           for j in range(cols):
               if grid[i, j] == 8:
                   if (i > 0 and grid[i - 1, j] == 0) or \
                      (i < rows - 1 and grid[i + 1, j] == 0) or \
                      (j > 0 and grid[i, j - 1] == 0) or \
                      (j < cols - 1 and grid[i, j + 1] == 0):
                       new_grid[i, j] = 1
       return new_grid

   final_output = transform_grid(test_input)
   print("Final Output Grid:\n", final_output)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Final Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

The ``final_output`` grid is the correct solution.  The previous issues stemmed from a misunderstanding of how to correctly update the ``working output grid`` in a step-by-step manner. The ``transform_grid`` function provides a more reliable way to ensure the correct transformation is applied comprehensively in a single operation.

Final Answer:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
