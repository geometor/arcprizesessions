The input grid in example 2 shows a scattered set of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some of the azure pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  Again, it appears that the replacement is based on adjacency to white pixels.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences at indices: {diff}")

   azure_count_input = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 8)
   blue_count_output = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 1)
   print(f"Azure count in input: {azure_count_input}")
   print(f"Blue count in output: {blue_count_output}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Differences at indices: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))
   Azure count in input: 8
   Blue count in output: 3

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 8
     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 8
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: near azure, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.

The code again confirms that azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been changed to blue.  The transformation rule appears consistent across both examples.
