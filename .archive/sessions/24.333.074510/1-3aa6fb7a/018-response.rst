The ``working output grid`` is still incomplete.  The step-by-step updates are proving unreliable in applying the transformation rule consistently.  The ``transform_grid`` function, however, correctly identifies and transforms all the relevant pixels.  Therefore, I will use the output of ``transform_grid`` as the final answer.  There is no need for further code execution or review, as the previously executed code sufficiently demonstrates the accuracy of the ``transform_grid`` function and its output.

Final Answer:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
