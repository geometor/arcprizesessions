The ``working output grid`` is still incomplete. Only two pixels have been changed, while the rule dictates that all azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels should be changed to blue (1).  The step-by-step updates are proving unreliable. The ``transform_grid`` function, however, correctly identifies and transforms all the necessary pixels. Therefore, I will use the output of the ``transform_grid`` function for my final answer. There's no need for further code execution or review since the previous code execution sufficiently demonstrated the accuracy of the ``transform_grid`` function and its output.

Final Answer:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
