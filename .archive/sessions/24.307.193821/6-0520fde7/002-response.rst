.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: predominantly white with a vertical blue stripe in the second column. The number 5 appears as a gray block in the center column
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 6
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: a cross pattern of red (2) cells.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 22
       colors_changed: Input has blue and gray, output has red. Size changed dramatically.
     transformation:
       - The transformation again significantly reduces the size of the grid.
       - It replaces most of the cells with white (0).
       - The central column of the input, containing the 5, seems to influence the output.  Here it generates a vertical cross pattern of red cells.
       - The relationship between input and output is not immediately clear, but the central column with the 5 seems pivotal

**Revised Thoughts and Hypotheses:**

Comparing ``example_1`` and ``example_2``\ :


* **Central Column Importance:** Both examples show the central column (containing a ``5``\ ) in the input plays a crucial role in determining the output.
* **Output Size:** The output size is consistently smaller than the input.  It appears to be a 3x3 grid in both cases.
* **Output Color:** The output uses primarily white (0) and red (2).
* **Pattern Complexity:** The pattern in the output seems to relate to the distribution of non-zero values in the central column of the input.  In example 1, we have a single red cell. In example 2, we have a cross pattern of red cells.

**Next Steps and Questions:**

To understand the transformation completely, more examples are crucial, especially ones that vary:


#. **Number of non-zero cells in the central column:**  What happens if there are more or fewer non-zero cells in the input's central column?
#. **Distribution of non-zero cells in the central column:** Does the vertical position of the non-zero values in the central column affect the pattern in the output?
#. **Presence of other colors in the central column:** How does the inclusion of colors other than 5 in the central column impact the output?
#. **Input size variation:** Would different input sizes change the output size or pattern?

I need more data to confidently formulate a rule.  The current hypothesis is that the input's central column influences the output's pattern and color distribution, but the exact relationship remains unclear.
