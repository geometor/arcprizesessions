**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying patterns and transformations:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 16
         - 1: 5
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: predominantly white with a vertical blue stripe.  The number 5 appears as a gray block in the center column
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 22
       colors_changed: Input has blue and gray, output has red. Size changed dramatically.
     transformation:
       - The transformation significantly reduces the size of the grid.
       - It replaces most of the cells with white (0)
       - It appears to focus on the central column of the input, creating a single red (2) cell in the center of the output.  There's no obvious mathematical relationship between the input and output values.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation is complex, and the relationship between input and output isn't immediately clear. It seems to be a process of simplification and reduction, focusing on a specific feature (the central column containing the ``5`` in the input) to produce a small, centered output. Further examples are needed to determine a consistent rule.  I'm particularly curious whether the position of the '5' in the input has a consistent relationship to the position of the '2' in the output, or if that was arbitrary.  I will need more examples to establish consistent rules.
