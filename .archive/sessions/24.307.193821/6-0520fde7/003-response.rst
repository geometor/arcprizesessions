   example_3:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: predominantly white with a vertical blue stripe. The number 5 appears as a gray block in the center column
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 7
         - 2: 2
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: two red cells, one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 22
       colors_changed: Input has blue and gray, output has red. Size changed dramatically.
     transformation:
       - The transformation again significantly reduces the size of the grid.
       - It replaces most of the cells with white (0).
       - The central column of the input, containing the 5, seems to influence the output.  Here it generates two red (2) cells in the corners.
       - The relationship between input and output is not immediately clear, but the central column with the 5 seems pivotal

**Further Refined Hypothesis:**

Based on the three examples, the hypothesis is strengthened that the central column of the input, particularly the presence and arrangement of non-zero values around the '5', directly impacts the output.  However, the precise mapping between input and output remains elusive.  The output seems to always be a 3x3 grid. The output's pattern is more complex than simply replicating the central column.  It's likely a function of the relative positions of 1s around the 5, or some other feature of its local surroundings.

**Next Steps & Data Needs:**

To confirm the hypothesis, I need more examples varying the following:


#. **Number of '1's in the central column:**  Vary the number of '1's above and below the '5' to see how the pattern in the output changes.
#. **Distance between '1's and '5':** Check if the vertical distance between the '1's and the '5' influences the position of red cells.
#. **Presence of other colors besides '1' in the central column:**  Introduce other colors around the '5' in the input to assess their effect.
#. **Input size:** While the examples have a consistent width, larger inputs could reveal further relationships.

Essentially, I need a more comprehensive set of examples to determine whether the relationship between the input's central column and the output is deterministic.  If so, that determination will allow for a precise description of the transformation rule.
