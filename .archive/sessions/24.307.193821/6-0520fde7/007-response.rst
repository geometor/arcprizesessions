The working output grid is currently a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white), which is my initial prediction based on the training examples.  However, since the input's central column is different from previous examples (only containing 5s), I need to carefully consider if this is a correct assessment.  Because there is no 1 around the 5,  a pattern of 2s might not appear.

Let's proceed cautiously. I will submit this solution as it appears to be the most likely solution based on the provided examples and my analysis. However, I'm not entirely confident as the test input presented a new situation that wasn't fully covered in the training data.  Additional examples, especially those with central columns containing only 5s and varying surrounding elements, would significantly enhance the accuracy of future predictions.
