            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying patterns and transformations:\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    width: 7\n    height: 3\n    colors:\n      - 0: 16\n      - 1: 5\n      - 5: 1\n    objects:\n      - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: predominantly white with a vertical blue stripe.  The number 5 appears as a gray block in the center column\n  output:\n    width: 3\n    height: 3\n    colors:\n      - 0: 8\n      - 2: 1\n    objects:\n      - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red\n  differences:\n    cells_changed: 22\n    colors_changed: Input has blue and gray, output has red. Size changed dramatically.\n  transformation:\n    - The transformation significantly reduces the size of the grid.\n    - It replaces most of the cells with white (0)\n    - It appears to focus on the central column of the input, creating a single red (2) cell in the center of the output.  There's no obvious mathematical relationship between the input and output values.\n```\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**\n\nThe transformation is complex, and the relationship between input and output isn't immediately clear. It seems to be a process of simplification and reduction, focusing on a specific feature (the central column containing the `5` in the input) to produce a small, centered output. Further examples are needed to determine a consistent rule.  I'm particularly curious whether the position of the '5' in the input has a consistent relationship to the position of the '2' in the output, or if that was arbitrary.  I will need more examples to establish consistent rules.\n"
