The number 5 appears as a gray block in the center column\n  output:\n    width: 3\n    height: 3\n    colors:\n      - 0: 6\n      - 2: 3\n    objects:\n      - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: a cross pattern of red (2) cells.\n  differences:\n    cells_changed: 22\n    colors_changed: Input has blue and gray, output has red. Size changed dramatically.\n  transformation:\n    - The transformation again significantly reduces the size of the grid.\n    - It replaces most of the cells with white (0).\n    - The central column of the input, containing the 5, seems to influence the output.  Here it generates a vertical cross pattern of red cells.\n    - The relationship between input and output is not immediately clear, but the central column with the 5 seems pivotal\n```\n\n**Revised Thoughts and Hypotheses:**\n\nComparing `example_1` and `example_2`:\n\n* **Central Column Importance:** Both examples show the central column (containing a `5`) in the input plays a crucial role in determining the output.\n* **Output Size:** The output size is consistently smaller than the input.  It appears to be a 3x3 grid in both cases.\n* **Output Color:** The output uses primarily white (0) and red (2).\n* **Pattern Complexity:** The pattern in the output seems to relate to the distribution of non-zero values in the central column of the input.  In example 1, we have a single red cell. In example 2, we have a cross pattern of red cells.\n\n**Next Steps and Questions:**\n\nTo understand the transformation completely, more examples are crucial, especially ones that vary:\n\n1. **Number of non-zero cells in the central column:**  What happens if there are more or fewer non-zero cells in the input's central column?\n2. **Distribution of non-zero cells in the central column:** Does the vertical position of the non-zero values in the central column affect the pattern in the output?\n3. **Presence of other colors in the central column:** How does the inclusion of colors other than 5 in the central column impact the output?\n4. **Input size variation:** Would different input sizes change the output size or pattern?\n\nI need more data to confidently formulate a rule.  The current hypothesis is that the input's central column influences the output's pattern and color distribution, but the exact relationship remains unclear.\n"
