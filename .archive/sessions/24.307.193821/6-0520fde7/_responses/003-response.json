The number 5 appears as a gray block in the center column\n  output:\n    width: 3\n    height: 3\n    colors:\n      - 0: 7\n      - 2: 2\n    objects:\n      - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: two red cells, one in the top-left and one in the bottom-right.\n  differences:\n    cells_changed: 22\n    colors_changed: Input has blue and gray, output has red. Size changed dramatically.\n  transformation:\n    - The transformation again significantly reduces the size of the grid.\n    - It replaces most of the cells with white (0).\n    - The central column of the input, containing the 5, seems to influence the output.  Here it generates two red (2) cells in the corners.\n    - The relationship between input and output is not immediately clear, but the central column with the 5 seems pivotal\n```\n\n**Further Refined Hypothesis:**\n\nBased on the three examples, the hypothesis is strengthened that the central column of the input, particularly the presence and arrangement of non-zero values around the '5', directly impacts the output.  However, the precise mapping between input and output remains elusive.  The output seems to always be a 3x3 grid. The output's pattern is more complex than simply replicating the central column.  It's likely a function of the relative positions of 1s around the 5, or some other feature of its local surroundings.\n\n**Next Steps & Data Needs:**\n\nTo confirm the hypothesis, I need more examples varying the following:\n\n1. **Number of '1's in the central column:**  Vary the number of '1's above and below the '5' to see how the pattern in the output changes.\n2. **Distance between '1's and '5':** Check if the vertical distance between the '1's and the '5' influences the position of red cells.\n3. **Presence of other colors besides '1' in the central column:**  Introduce other colors around the '5' in the input to assess their effect.\n4. **Input size:** While the examples have a consistent width, larger inputs could reveal further relationships.\n\nEssentially, I need a more comprehensive set of examples to determine whether the relationship between the input's central column and the output is deterministic.  If so, that determination will allow for a precise description of the transformation rule.\n"
