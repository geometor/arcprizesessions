Based on the previous examples, the central column of the input, along with its surrounding elements, appears to dictate the output pattern.  Let's analyze the central column of the test input:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]])

   test_input_center = test_input[:, 3]  # Extract the central column
   print("Test Input Center:", test_input_center)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Test Input Center: [5 5 5]



The central column consists entirely of 5s.  This is a new scenario not encountered in the training examples.  The previous examples suggested that the arrangement of 1s around the central 5 influenced the pattern of 2s in the 3x3 output.  Since there are no 1s in this case, we might expect a different output pattern than those observed previously.  It's possible that the absence of 1s leads to the absence of 2s or some other transformation rule related to the presence or absence of neighboring non-zero values.

Let's predict the output based on what we've learned so far:

**Prediction:**

Given the complete absence of 1s surrounding the 5s in the central column, the simplest prediction is a 3x3 grid filled entirely with 0s (white). However, this is a guess based on the observed trend in the previous examples.  There may be another rule that governs the case when the central column only contains 5s.  A completely blank 3x3 grid is the most conservative prediction based on existing information.

To test this, we'll need to continue with the test phase using the tools provided.  The lack of clear pattern in the central column in this specific input makes the output very difficult to determine without further examples or specific feedback in a step-by-step iterative manner in a tool based approach that allows for more examples or clues to refine my prediction.  Let's proceed with the test phase and see what happens.
