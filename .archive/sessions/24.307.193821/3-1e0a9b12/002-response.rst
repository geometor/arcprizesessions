     input:
       width: 6
       height: 6
       colors:
         - 0: 29
         - 4: 3
         - 7: 2
         - 8: 2
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,3), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,5), color: maroon

     output:
       width: 6
       height: 6
       colors:
         - 0: 33
         - 4: 3
         - 7: 2
         - 8: 2
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,5), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,5), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,5), color: maroon

     differences:
       cells_changed: 5
       colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.

     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, non-white pixels are moved to the bottom row, preserving relative positions.  The bottom row is populated from the input, bottom-up.  This example shows that the bottom row can accommodate more pixels than in example_1, and it is populated from the bottom row up.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule appears to be:  All non-white pixels from the input grid are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The bottom row is filled from the bottom-up. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with white pixels.

**Further Testing:**

More examples are needed to test the following:


#. Inputs of varying sizes and with different numbers of non-white pixels.
#. Inputs where the non-white pixels are not clustered in a single area.
#. Inputs containing all 10 colors.

I am ready for the next example or the test input.
