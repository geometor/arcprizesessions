The bottom row is filled from the bottom up.\n```\n\nThe pattern holds consistently across all three examples.  My hypothesis is confirmed.  The transformation involves moving all non-white pixels to the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative order and positions within that row, filling from bottom-up. The rest of the output grid is filled with white pixels.  I'm ready for the test input.\n"
