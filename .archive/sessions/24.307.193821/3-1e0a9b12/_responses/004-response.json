            "text": "The transformation rule consistently observed across all three examples is as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Non-White Pixels:**  The algorithm identifies all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color value 0).\n\n2. **Preserve Relative Positions:** The relative positions of these non-white pixels are maintained.  Their x and y coordinates relative to each other remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Bottom Row Population (Bottom-Up):** These non-white pixels are moved to the bottom row of the output grid. The bottom row is filled from bottom-up;  the pixel at the lowest y coordinate in the input occupies the leftmost position in the bottom row of the output, and so on.\n\n4. **Fill with White:** All remaining cells in the output grid (not occupied by the relocated non-white pixels) are filled with white pixels.\n\nThis rule holds irrespective of the size of the input grid or the number and distribution of non-white pixels.  The key is the preservation of relative position within the bottom row and filling the bottom row bottom-up.\n\n\nNow, I'm ready for the test input.\n"
