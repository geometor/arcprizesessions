The bottom row is populated from the input, bottom-up.  This example shows that the bottom row can accommodate more pixels than in example_1, and it is populated from the bottom row up.\n```\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to be:  All non-white pixels from the input grid are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The bottom row is filled from the bottom-up. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with white pixels.\n\n\n**Further Testing:**\n\nMore examples are needed to test the following:\n\n1.  Inputs of varying sizes and with different numbers of non-white pixels.\n2.  Inputs where the non-white pixels are not clustered in a single area.\n3.  Inputs containing all 10 colors.\n\nI am ready for the next example or the test input.\n"
