Many white pixels are added.\n\n  transformation:\n    - The non-zero colored pixels in the input seem to be collected and placed in the bottom row of the output, maintaining their relative positions.  The order is preserved.  The bottom row is populated by the non-zero pixels in the input.\n```\n\n**Initial Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation appears to involve collecting all the non-white pixels from the input and placing them in the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative order and positions within that row.  Additional white pixels fill the remaining cells.\n\n**Further Questions:**\n\n1.  Does this pattern hold true for other input grids?  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n2.  What happens if there are more than 4 non-white pixels?  Will they still fit in the bottom row?  Will the rule change?\n3.  What if the input grid is a different size?\n\n\nI need more examples to verify my hypothesis and understand the rule more comprehensively.\n"
