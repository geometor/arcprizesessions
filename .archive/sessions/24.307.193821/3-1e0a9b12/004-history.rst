Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 4
       height: 4
       colors:
         - 0: 10
         - 1: 1
         - 4: 2
         - 6: 1
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: maroon
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,3), color: blue

     output:
       width: 4
       height: 4
       colors:
         - 0: 12
         - 1: 1
         - 4: 2
         - 6: 1
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow

     differences:
       cells_changed: 10
       colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels from the input appear in the bottom row of the output, maintaining their relative positions, with the addition of another yellow pixel.  Many white pixels are added.

     transformation:
       - The non-zero colored pixels in the input seem to be collected and placed in the bottom row of the output, maintaining their relative positions.  The order is preserved.  The bottom row is populated by the non-zero pixels in the input.

**Initial Hypothesis:**

The transformation appears to involve collecting all the non-white pixels from the input and placing them in the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative order and positions within that row.  Additional white pixels fill the remaining cells.

**Further Questions:**


#. Does this pattern hold true for other input grids?  More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
#. What happens if there are more than 4 non-white pixels?  Will they still fit in the bottom row?  Will the rule change?
#. What if the input grid is a different size?

I need more examples to verify my hypothesis and understand the rule more comprehensively.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 6
       height: 6
       colors:
         - 0: 29
         - 4: 3
         - 7: 2
         - 8: 2
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,3), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,3), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,5), color: maroon

     output:
       width: 6
       height: 6
       colors:
         - 0: 33
         - 4: 3
         - 7: 2
         - 8: 2
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,0), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,2), color: orange
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,5), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,5), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,5), color: maroon

     differences:
       cells_changed: 5
       colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions.

     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, non-white pixels are moved to the bottom row, preserving relative positions.  The bottom row is populated from the input, bottom-up.  This example shows that the bottom row can accommodate more pixels than in example_1, and it is populated from the bottom row up.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule appears to be:  All non-white pixels from the input grid are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. The bottom row is filled from the bottom-up. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with white pixels.

**Further Testing:**

More examples are needed to test the following:


#. Inputs of varying sizes and with different numbers of non-white pixels.
#. Inputs where the non-white pixels are not clustered in a single area.
#. Inputs containing all 10 colors.

I am ready for the next example or the test input.

     output:
       width: 5
       height: 5
       colors:
         - 0: 22
         - 1: 2
         - 2: 1
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,4), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,3), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,4), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: The non-zero pixels are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions and order. The bottom row is populated from the bottom up.

     transformation:
       - The transformation is consistent with the previous examples: Non-white pixels are moved to the bottom row, preserving their relative positions and order.  The bottom row is filled from the bottom up.

The pattern holds consistently across all three examples.  My hypothesis is confirmed.  The transformation involves moving all non-white pixels to the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative order and positions within that row, filling from bottom-up. The rest of the output grid is filled with white pixels.  I'm ready for the test input.
