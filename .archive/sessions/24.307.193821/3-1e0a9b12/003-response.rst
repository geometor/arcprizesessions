         - size: 1x1, position: (4,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: blue

     output:
       width: 5
       height: 5
       colors:
         - 0: 22
         - 1: 2
         - 2: 1
         - 3: 3

       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,4), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,3), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,4), color: green
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (4,4), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: The non-zero pixels are moved to the bottom row, maintaining their relative positions and order. The bottom row is populated from the bottom up.

     transformation:
       - The transformation is consistent with the previous examples: Non-white pixels are moved to the bottom row, preserving their relative positions and order.  The bottom row is filled from the bottom up.

The pattern holds consistently across all three examples.  My hypothesis is confirmed.  The transformation involves moving all non-white pixels to the bottom row of the output grid, preserving their relative order and positions within that row, filling from bottom-up. The rest of the output grid is filled with white pixels.  I'm ready for the test input.
