The transformation rule consistently observed across all three examples is as follows:


#. 
   **Identify Non-White Pixels:**  The algorithm identifies all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color value 0).

#. 
   **Preserve Relative Positions:** The relative positions of these non-white pixels are maintained.  Their x and y coordinates relative to each other remain unchanged.

#. 
   **Bottom Row Population (Bottom-Up):** These non-white pixels are moved to the bottom row of the output grid. The bottom row is filled from bottom-up;  the pixel at the lowest y coordinate in the input occupies the leftmost position in the bottom row of the output, and so on.

#. 
   **Fill with White:** All remaining cells in the output grid (not occupied by the relocated non-white pixels) are filled with white pixels.

This rule holds irrespective of the size of the input grid or the number and distribution of non-white pixels.  The key is the preservation of relative position within the bottom row and filling the bottom row bottom-up.

Now, I'm ready for the test input.
