         - 0: 54

     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced with a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the same object shape.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, the gray object is recolored.  The majority of the gray pixels become azure (8), while some become red (2). The red pixels appear to be placed symmetrically and sparsely within the azure object.  The shape and position remain constant.

**Revised Thoughts and Reasoning:**

The pattern is becoming clearer.  The transformation consistently involves:


#. **Object Preservation:** The shape and location of the gray object remain unchanged.
#. **Color Recoding:**  Gray pixels (5) are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.
#. **Red Pixel Placement:** The red pixels appear to be strategically placed within the azure region, possibly reflecting some symmetry or a pattern related to the gray object's structure.  It's not a simple replacement; it’s a more complex substitution.

Further analysis requires more examples to determine the precise rule governing the placement of red pixels within the azure region. The rule appears to be symmetrical and position-dependent, possibly involving adjacency or distance to the object's edges.  A hypothesis is that red (2) is substituted for grey (5) when the grey pixel has 2 or more grey neighbors.  Let's check more examples to test this hypothesis.

**Next Steps:**

More examples are needed to definitively determine the rule for red pixel placement. We need to consider the possibility that other factors beyond simple adjacency or symmetry might be in play.  Ideally, we'd like to see examples with varying gray object shapes and sizes to confirm that the transformation remains consistent.
