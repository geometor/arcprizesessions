Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 82
         - 5: 17
       objects:
         - size: 17, position: center-left, color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 74
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 17
       objects:
         - size: 17, position: center-left, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 17
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced with a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the same object shape.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is re-colored.  Gray (5) is replaced by azure (8) except for some cells which become red (2). The red cells seem to form a slightly smaller object within the azure object. The overall shape of the original gray object is preserved.

**Initial Thoughts and Reasoning:**

The transformation appears to involve a recoding of the gray object.  It's not a simple color change; the gray is being replaced with a combination of azure and red colors in a structured way. The new colors seem to represent sub-structures of the original gray shape. The exact rule for placement of red pixels within the azure object is unclear from only one example.  Further examples are needed to confidently define that rule.  The location and size of the gray object remain unchanged.

**Next Steps:**

To gain better insight into the rule, I need more examples.  The placement of the red pixels (2) within the azure pixels (8) needs clarification. The algorithm replacing the 5s in the input needs to be clarified. Is it related to location or adjacency to other pixels?

Let's proceed to more examples to formulate a robust transformation rule and test it.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 62
         - 5: 18
       objects:
         - size: 18, position: center-left, color: gray
     output:

       colors:
         - 0: 54
         - 2: 6
         - 8: 12
       objects:
         - size: 18, position: center-left, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 18
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced with a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the same object shape.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, the gray object is recolored.  The majority of the gray pixels become azure (8), while some become red (2). The red pixels appear to be placed symmetrically and sparsely within the azure object.  The shape and position remain constant.

**Revised Thoughts and Reasoning:**

The pattern is becoming clearer.  The transformation consistently involves:


#. **Object Preservation:** The shape and location of the gray object remain unchanged.
#. **Color Recoding:**  Gray pixels (5) are replaced by a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels.
#. **Red Pixel Placement:** The red pixels appear to be strategically placed within the azure region, possibly reflecting some symmetry or a pattern related to the gray object's structure.  It's not a simple replacement; it’s a more complex substitution.

Further analysis requires more examples to determine the precise rule governing the placement of red pixels within the azure region. The rule appears to be symmetrical and position-dependent, possibly involving adjacency or distance to the object's edges.  A hypothesis is that red (2) is substituted for grey (5) when the grey pixel has 2 or more grey neighbors.  Let's check more examples to test this hypothesis.

**Next Steps:**

More examples are needed to definitively determine the rule for red pixel placement. We need to consider the possibility that other factors beyond simple adjacency or symmetry might be in play.  Ideally, we'd like to see examples with varying gray object shapes and sizes to confirm that the transformation remains consistent.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced with azure and red pixels.
     transformation:
       - The gray object is recolored. The majority becomes azure; some become red.  The red pixels appear on the outer edge or near the edges of the object.

**Further Refined Thoughts and Reasoning:**

Based on these three examples, the hypothesis that red (2) replaces gray (5) when the grey pixel has 2 or more gray neighbors is not fully accurate.  The placement of red and azure pixels seems more complex and related to the perimeter of the gray object. It is not merely about the number of gray neighbors.  The transformation appears to prioritize preserving the shape and size of the original gray object while replacing the interior mostly with azure and bordering elements with red.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

Gray pixels (5) are replaced as follows:


* **Interior Gray Pixels:** Primarily replaced with azure (8).
* **Perimeter Gray Pixels:**  A significant portion replaced with red (2), especially those on the outer edges or with fewer gray neighbors.

**Next Steps:**

To further refine the hypothesis and test it, we need more examples with a wider variety of gray object shapes, sizes, and locations within the grid.  This will help confirm the transformation rule and identify any exceptions or edge cases.  Specifically, examples that involve the object touching boundaries of the grid would help refine this hypothesis.



**examples summary**



Based on the three examples, the transformation from input to output involves a recoding of a gray (5) object into a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels while preserving the object's overall shape and location.  The rule seems to be based on the position of the gray pixels relative to the object's perimeter:


* 
  **Core Object:** Interior gray pixels (those surrounded by other gray pixels) are primarily replaced with azure (8).

* 
  **Object Perimeter:** Gray pixels on or near the edge of the object (those with fewer gray neighbors) are replaced by red (2).  The exact criteria for determining "near the edge" remains to be fully defined, but it seems to prioritize creating a red border or outline around the azure core.

The following code demonstrates a simple attempt at capturing this pattern, though it's incomplete due to the uncertainty about the precise perimeter definition:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       """Transforms a grid based on the observed pattern.  This is a partial implementation."""
       gray_indices = np.where(grid == 5)
       gray_coords = list(zip(gray_indices[0], gray_indices[1]))
       height, width = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)

       for r, c in gray_coords:
           #Crude approximation, needs refinement
           is_perimeter = (r == 0 or r == height - 1 or c == 0 or c == width - 1) or (grid[r-1][c] == 0 or grid[r+1][c] ==0 or grid[r][c-1] == 0 or grid[r][c+1] == 0)
           new_grid[r, c] = 2 if is_perimeter else 8

       return new_grid


   # Example usage (requires a NumPy array representation of the grid):
   example_input_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   transformed_grid = transform_grid(example_input_1)
   print(transformed_grid)

The ``transform_grid`` function provides a rudimentary attempt to model the transformation.  It correctly identifies some perimeter pixels, but it's not perfect and needs refinement. The current perimeter check is too simplistic and misses some edge cases.  A more sophisticated algorithm is needed to accurately capture the rule governing red pixel placement. This will likely involve analyzing pixel adjacency and potentially considering the overall shape and connectivity of the gray object.  More examples are crucial to refine this algorithm.
