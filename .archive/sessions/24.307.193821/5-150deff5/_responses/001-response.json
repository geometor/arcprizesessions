Gray (5) is replaced by azure (8) except for some cells which become red (2). The red cells seem to form a slightly smaller object within the azure object. The overall shape of the original gray object is preserved.\n```\n\n**Initial Thoughts and Reasoning:**\n\nThe transformation appears to involve a recoding of the gray object.  It's not a simple color change; the gray is being replaced with a combination of azure and red colors in a structured way. The new colors seem to represent sub-structures of the original gray shape. The exact rule for placement of red pixels within the azure object is unclear from only one example.  Further examples are needed to confidently define that rule.  The location and size of the gray object remain unchanged.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo gain better insight into the rule, I need more examples.  The placement of the red pixels (2) within the azure pixels (8) needs clarification. The algorithm replacing the 5s in the input needs to be clarified. Is it related to location or adjacency to other pixels?\n\nLet's proceed to more examples to formulate a robust transformation rule and test it.\n"
