The rule seems to be based on the position of the gray pixels relative to the object's perimeter:\n\n* **Core Object:** Interior gray pixels (those surrounded by other gray pixels) are primarily replaced with azure (8).\n\n* **Object Perimeter:** Gray pixels on or near the edge of the object (those with fewer gray neighbors) are replaced by red (2).  The exact criteria for determining \"near the edge\" remains to be fully defined, but it seems to prioritize creating a red border or outline around the azure core.\n\nThe following code demonstrates a simple attempt at capturing this pattern, though it's incomplete due to the uncertainty about the precise perimeter definition:\n\n"

This will likely involve analyzing pixel adjacency and potentially considering the overall shape and connectivity of the gray object.  More examples are crucial to refine this algorithm.\n"
