The majority becomes azure; some become red.  The red pixels appear on the outer edge or near the edges of the object.\n```\n\n**Further Refined Thoughts and Reasoning:**\n\nBased on these three examples, the hypothesis that red (2) replaces gray (5) when the grey pixel has 2 or more gray neighbors is not fully accurate.  The placement of red and azure pixels seems more complex and related to the perimeter of the gray object. It is not merely about the number of gray neighbors.  The transformation appears to prioritize preserving the shape and size of the original gray object while replacing the interior mostly with azure and bordering elements with red.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nGray pixels (5) are replaced as follows:\n\n*   **Interior Gray Pixels:** Primarily replaced with azure (8).\n*   **Perimeter Gray Pixels:**  A significant portion replaced with red (2), especially those on the outer edges or with fewer gray neighbors.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nTo further refine the hypothesis and test it, we need more examples with a wider variety of gray object shapes, sizes, and locations within the grid.  This will help confirm the transformation rule and identify any exceptions or edge cases.  Specifically, examples that involve the object touching boundaries of the grid would help refine this hypothesis.\n"
