Based on the three examples, the transformation from input to output involves a recoding of a gray (5) object into a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels while preserving the object's overall shape and location.  The rule seems to be based on the position of the gray pixels relative to the object's perimeter:


* 
  **Core Object:** Interior gray pixels (those surrounded by other gray pixels) are primarily replaced with azure (8).

* 
  **Object Perimeter:** Gray pixels on or near the edge of the object (those with fewer gray neighbors) are replaced by red (2).  The exact criteria for determining "near the edge" remains to be fully defined, but it seems to prioritize creating a red border or outline around the azure core.

The following code demonstrates a simple attempt at capturing this pattern, though it's incomplete due to the uncertainty about the precise perimeter definition:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       """Transforms a grid based on the observed pattern.  This is a partial implementation."""
       gray_indices = np.where(grid == 5)
       gray_coords = list(zip(gray_indices[0], gray_indices[1]))
       height, width = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)

       for r, c in gray_coords:
           #Crude approximation, needs refinement
           is_perimeter = (r == 0 or r == height - 1 or c == 0 or c == width - 1) or (grid[r-1][c] == 0 or grid[r+1][c] ==0 or grid[r][c-1] == 0 or grid[r][c+1] == 0)
           new_grid[r, c] = 2 if is_perimeter else 8

       return new_grid


   # Example usage (requires a NumPy array representation of the grid):
   example_input_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

The ``transform_grid`` function provides a rudimentary attempt to model the transformation.  It correctly identifies some perimeter pixels, but it's not perfect and needs refinement. The current perimeter check is too simplistic and misses some edge cases.  A more sophisticated algorithm is needed to accurately capture the rule governing red pixel placement. This will likely involve analyzing pixel adjacency and potentially considering the overall shape and connectivity of the gray object.  More examples are crucial to refine this algorithm.
