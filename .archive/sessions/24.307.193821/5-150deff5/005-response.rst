   test_input:
     width: 11
     height: 8
     colors:
       - 0: 59
       - 5: 20
     objects:
       - size: 20, position: center-left, color: gray, description: Irregular, somewhat L-shaped object

The test input features a gray object of size 20, positioned in the center-left of the grid. Its shape is irregular, unlike the relatively more compact objects in the training examples.  This irregularity will test the robustness of the transformation rule derived from the examples.  The current hypothesis, which focuses on proximity to the object's edges, might need adjustments to handle such complex shapes accurately.

Let's use the existing ``transform_grid`` function as a starting point, but anticipate it needing further refinement:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       gray_indices = np.where(grid == 5)
       gray_coords = list(zip(gray_indices[0], gray_indices[1]))
       height, width = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)

       for r, c in gray_coords:
           count = 0
           for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
               nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
               if 0 <= nr < height and 0 <= nc < width and grid[nr, nc] == 5:
                   count += 1
           if count < 4 : #check for four neighbors
             new_grid[r, c] = 2
           else:
             new_grid[r, c] = 8

       return new_grid

   test_input_array = np.array([[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   transformed_grid = transform_grid(test_input_array)
   print(transformed_grid)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0]
    [0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]



The revised ``transform_grid`` function provides a more accurate transformation.  The algorithm now considers the number of gray neighbors (up, down, left, right) for each gray pixel. If a gray pixel has fewer than 4 gray neighbors, it is classified as a perimeter pixel and recolored red (2); otherwise, it's considered an interior pixel and recolored azure (8).

This approach addresses the complexity of the irregular shape in the test input more effectively than the previous, simpler perimeter check.  The result shows the gray shape is transformed using the red and azure colors according to our hypothesis about neighbors.  While this is a significant improvement, further refinements could involve:


* More sophisticated neighbor analysis:  Consider diagonal neighbors, or more advanced techniques from image processing (e.g., edge detection algorithms).
* Handling different object sizes:  The current rule seems to work well, but more testing with differently sized objects is needed to check whether the rule still applies.
* Handling different object shapes:  Similarly, further testing with very differently-shaped objects would be required.

The generated output is a reasonable first attempt based on the patterns observed in the training examples, however, without more examples and more rigorous testing, it may not perfectly reflect the overall transformation rule.  Additional examples, particularly with objects that are even more irregular in shape, might be necessary to refine the solution further.
