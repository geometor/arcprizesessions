   example_2:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 2: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 8: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: red, green, azure. A repeating pattern of red, green, azure.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 6: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 9: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: magenta, yellow, maroon. A repeating pattern of magenta, yellow, maroon.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.

The transformation in example_2 further supports the hypothesis that the puzzle involves a color mapping.  Let's combine the findings from both examples:

Example 1:


* Input: 1 -> Output: 4
* Input: 2 -> Output: 5
* Input: 3 -> Output: 6

Example 2:


* Input: 2 -> Output: 6
* Input: 3 -> Output: 4
* Input: 8 -> Output: 9

There's a consistent color mapping, but it's not a simple linear function.  More examples are needed to fully define the mapping.  The pattern seems to be more complex than a simple addition or subtraction.
