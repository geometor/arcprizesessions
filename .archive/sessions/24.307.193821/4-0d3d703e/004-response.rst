   example_4:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 9: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: maroon, yellow, red. A repeating pattern of maroon, yellow, red.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 8: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: azure, green, magenta. A repeating pattern of azure, green, magenta.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.

Let's update the color mapping based on example 4:

**Example 1:**


* 1 -> 4
* 2 -> 5
* 3 -> 6

**Example 2:**


* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 8 -> 9

**Example 3:**


* 5 -> 1
* 8 -> 9
* 6 -> 2

**Example 4:**


* 9 -> 8
* 4 -> 3
* 2 -> 6

At this point, I still don't see a clear, consistent mathematical rule. The mapping appears arbitrary.  I hypothesize that there is a fixed mapping between the input and output colors. To verify this and determine the full mapping, I need more examples, ideally including all 10 colors.  Additional examples will allow for a more robust and complete determination of the color transformation.
