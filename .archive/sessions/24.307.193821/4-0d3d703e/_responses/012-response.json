The current working output grid is incorrect, and any further modifications based on the incomplete information will also likely be incorrect.  We must have more examples to establish a complete color permutation.  The previous attempts to update the working grid demonstrate the insufficiency of the current data.  The solution requires a complete and unambiguous mapping from input colors to output colors, which we currently lack.\n"
