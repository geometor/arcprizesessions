A repeating pattern of blue, maroon, red.\n  differences:\n    cells_changed: 9\n    colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.\n  transformation:\n    - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.\n```\n\nNow let's consolidate the color mappings from all three examples:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- 1 -> 4\n- 2 -> 5\n- 3 -> 6\n\n**Example 2:**\n- 2 -> 6\n- 3 -> 4\n- 8 -> 9\n\n**Example 3:**\n- 5 -> 1\n- 8 -> 9\n- 6 -> 2\n\nThere's no immediately apparent mathematical or logical rule governing this mapping.  It's not a simple arithmetic operation or a consistent pattern based on color adjacency.  It may be a arbitrary pre-defined mapping,  or perhaps a more complex rule involving color order or other factors that are not obvious from these three examples.  Additional examples are crucial to uncovering a possible pattern.\n\nTo proceed, I need more examples to determine the underlying transformation rule.  The current examples suggest a color-mapping transformation, but more data points are required to definitively identify the mapping function.\n"
