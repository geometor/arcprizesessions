            "text": "The provided examples demonstrate a consistent transformation: a permutation of colors between input and output grids. The spatial arrangement of colors remains identical; only the color values change.  There's no discernible mathematical or logical pattern in the color mapping evident from just these four examples.  The mapping appears arbitrary.\n\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis and fully determine the color permutation, we need more examples, ideally including all 10 possible colors (0-9) in various input configurations.\n\n\nHere's a summary of the observed color mappings:\n\n| Input Color | Output Color |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | 4 |\n| 2 | 5, 6 |\n| 3 | 4, 6 |\n| 4 | 3 |\n| 5 | 1 |\n| 6 | 2 |\n| 8 | 9 |\n| 9 | 8 |\n\n\nThe inconsistencies in the mapping for colors 2, 3, and 6 suggest additional examples are critical to define the complete permutation.  A complete mapping would enable us to confidently predict the output for any given input.  Without a full mapping, we can only speculate on the transformation rule.\n\nI propose the following strategy to determine the complete transformation:\n\n1. **Gather more examples:** Request additional examples until all ten colors (0-9) appear in different input arrangements to eliminate ambiguity.\n2. **Create a mapping table:** Once enough examples are provided, build a table to show the mapping, one-to-one correspondence between input and output colors.\n3. **Verify and refine:** Test the proposed color mapping with new examples to verify its correctness and refine it if necessary.\n\n\nI'm ready for more examples to complete the mapping and fully characterize the transformation.\n"
