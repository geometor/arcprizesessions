The current state is that we have an incomplete and ambiguous color mapping derived from four examples.  Attempting to proceed without a complete mapping is futile.  The current working output grid is incorrect, and any further modifications based on the incomplete information will also likely be incorrect.  We must have more examples to establish a complete color permutation.  The previous attempts to update the working grid demonstrate the insufficiency of the current data.  The solution requires a complete and unambiguous mapping from input colors to output colors, which we currently lack.
