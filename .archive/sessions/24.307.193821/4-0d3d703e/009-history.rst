       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 2: 3
         - 3: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: green, blue, red.  A repeating pattern of green, blue, red.
     output:

       height: 3
       colors:
         - 4: 3
         - 5: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: yellow, gray, magenta. A repeating pattern of yellow, gray, magenta.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid.  The arrangement of colors remains the same.  The transformation is a simple color mapping.

The transformation appears to be a simple mapping of input colors to output colors.  There's no change in the spatial arrangement of the colors; only their values are changed.  To determine the exact mapping, more examples would be helpful.

       colors:

         - 8: 3
       objects:

       colors:
         - 6: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 9: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: magenta, yellow, maroon. A repeating pattern of magenta, yellow, maroon.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.

The transformation in example_2 further supports the hypothesis that the puzzle involves a color mapping.  Let's combine the findings from both examples:

Example 1:


* Input: 1 -> Output: 4
* Input: 2 -> Output: 5
* Input: 3 -> Output: 6

Example 2:


* Input: 2 -> Output: 6
* Input: 3 -> Output: 4
* Input: 8 -> Output: 9

There's a consistent color mapping, but it's not a simple linear function.  More examples are needed to fully define the mapping.  The pattern seems to be more complex than a simple addition or subtraction.

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: gray, azure, magenta. A repeating pattern of gray, azure, magenta.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: blue, maroon, red. A repeating pattern of blue, maroon, red.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.

Now let's consolidate the color mappings from all three examples:

**Example 1:**


* 1 -> 4
* 2 -> 5
* 3 -> 6

**Example 2:**


* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 8 -> 9

**Example 3:**


* 5 -> 1
* 8 -> 9
* 6 -> 2

There's no immediately apparent mathematical or logical rule governing this mapping.  It's not a simple arithmetic operation or a consistent pattern based on color adjacency.  It may be a arbitrary pre-defined mapping,  or perhaps a more complex rule involving color order or other factors that are not obvious from these three examples.  Additional examples are crucial to uncovering a possible pattern.

To proceed, I need more examples to determine the underlying transformation rule.  The current examples suggest a color-mapping transformation, but more data points are required to definitively identify the mapping function.

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_4:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 9: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: maroon, yellow, red. A repeating pattern of maroon, yellow, red.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 8: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: azure, green, magenta. A repeating pattern of azure, green, magenta.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.

Let's update the color mapping based on example 4:

**Example 1:**


* 1 -> 4
* 2 -> 5
* 3 -> 6

**Example 2:**


* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 8 -> 9

**Example 3:**


* 5 -> 1
* 8 -> 9
* 6 -> 2

**Example 4:**


* 9 -> 8
* 4 -> 3
* 2 -> 6

At this point, I still don't see a clear, consistent mathematical rule. The mapping appears arbitrary.  I hypothesize that there is a fixed mapping between the input and output colors. To verify this and determine the full mapping, I need more examples, ideally including all 10 colors.  Additional examples will allow for a more robust and complete determination of the color transformation.



**examples summary**



The provided examples demonstrate a consistent transformation: a permutation of colors between input and output grids. The spatial arrangement of colors remains identical; only the color values change.  There's no discernible mathematical or logical pattern in the color mapping evident from just these four examples.  The mapping appears arbitrary.

To confirm this hypothesis and fully determine the color permutation, we need more examples, ideally including all 10 possible colors (0-9) in various input configurations.

Here's a summary of the observed color mappings:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Color
     - Output Color
   * - 1
     - 4
   * - 2
     - 5, 6
   * - 3
     - 4, 6
   * - 4
     - 3
   * - 5
     - 1
   * - 6
     - 2
   * - 8
     - 9
   * - 9
     - 8


The inconsistencies in the mapping for colors 2, 3, and 6 suggest additional examples are critical to define the complete permutation.  A complete mapping would enable us to confidently predict the output for any given input.  Without a full mapping, we can only speculate on the transformation rule.

I propose the following strategy to determine the complete transformation:


#. **Gather more examples:** Request additional examples until all ten colors (0-9) appear in different input arrangements to eliminate ambiguity.
#. **Create a mapping table:** Once enough examples are provided, build a table to show the mapping, one-to-one correspondence between input and output colors.
#. **Verify and refine:** Test the proposed color mapping with new examples to verify its correctness and refine it if necessary.

I'm ready for more examples to complete the mapping and fully characterize the transformation.



**test**



**input**



.. code-block::

    [[8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]]


.. image:: _images/005-test_input.png
   :alt: _images/005-test_input.png



**observations**



Based on the previous examples, the transformation is a permutation of colors.  Let's use the existing data to create a mapping table.  However, the data is incomplete and ambiguous for some colors.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Color
     - Output Color
   * - 1
     - 4
   * - 2
     - 5, 6
   * - 3
     - 4, 6
   * - 4
     - 3
   * - 5
     - 1
   * - 6
     - 2
   * - 8
     - 9
   * - 9
     - 8


The test input is ``[[8 1 3], [8 1 3], [8 1 3]]``.  Using the incomplete mapping:


* 8 maps to 9
* 1 maps to 4
* 3 maps to 4 or 6

Because the mapping is not fully defined, we cannot definitively determine the output.  We need more examples to resolve the ambiguity.

To solve this puzzle, we must obtain a complete color mapping.  I need more examples to confidently predict the output for the test input.

**Request:**  Please provide additional examples of input-output pairs, including examples that fully resolve the mapping ambiguities for colors 2, 3, and 6.  The additional examples should ideally include all ten colors (0-9) in different input configurations to determine the complete permutation.



**initialize the working output grid:**

**working output grid**



updated with your changes



.. code-block::

    [[8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]]


.. image:: _images/005-test_input.png
   :alt: _images/005-test_input.png



The current situation highlights the limitations of inferring a complete transformation rule from a limited number of examples.  The ambiguity in the color mappings prevents a confident prediction for the test input.  To proceed, additional examples are absolutely necessary.  The request for more examples is justified and crucial for solving the puzzle.  Until a complete and unambiguous mapping is provided, any attempt to predict the output would be purely speculative.
