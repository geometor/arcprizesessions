Based on the previous examples, the transformation is a permutation of colors.  Let's use the existing data to create a mapping table.  However, the data is incomplete and ambiguous for some colors.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Input Color
     - Output Color
   * - 1
     - 4
   * - 2
     - 5, 6
   * - 3
     - 4, 6
   * - 4
     - 3
   * - 5
     - 1
   * - 6
     - 2
   * - 8
     - 9
   * - 9
     - 8


The test input is ``[[8 1 3], [8 1 3], [8 1 3]]``.  Using the incomplete mapping:


* 8 maps to 9
* 1 maps to 4
* 3 maps to 4 or 6

Because the mapping is not fully defined, we cannot definitively determine the output.  We need more examples to resolve the ambiguity.

To solve this puzzle, we must obtain a complete color mapping.  I need more examples to confidently predict the output for the test input.

**Request:**  Please provide additional examples of input-output pairs, including examples that fully resolve the mapping ambiguities for colors 2, 3, and 6.  The additional examples should ideally include all ten colors (0-9) in different input configurations to determine the complete permutation.
