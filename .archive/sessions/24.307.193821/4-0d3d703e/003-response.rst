   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: gray, azure, magenta. A repeating pattern of gray, azure, magenta.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: blue, maroon, red. A repeating pattern of blue, maroon, red.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. Each color in the input has been replaced by a different color in the output.
     transformation:
       - Each color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid. The arrangement of colors remains the same. The transformation is a simple color mapping.

Now let's consolidate the color mappings from all three examples:

**Example 1:**


* 1 -> 4
* 2 -> 5
* 3 -> 6

**Example 2:**


* 2 -> 6
* 3 -> 4
* 8 -> 9

**Example 3:**


* 5 -> 1
* 8 -> 9
* 6 -> 2

There's no immediately apparent mathematical or logical rule governing this mapping.  It's not a simple arithmetic operation or a consistent pattern based on color adjacency.  It may be a arbitrary pre-defined mapping,  or perhaps a more complex rule involving color order or other factors that are not obvious from these three examples.  Additional examples are crucial to uncovering a possible pattern.

To proceed, I need more examples to determine the underlying transformation rule.  The current examples suggest a color-mapping transformation, but more data points are required to definitively identify the mapping function.
