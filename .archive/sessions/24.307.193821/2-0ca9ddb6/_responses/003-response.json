A 2x2 cross pattern of yellow and orange is added around each cell that is not white. The pattern of yellow and orange remains consistent.\n```\n\nThe third example further confirms the hypothesized transformation rule.  The pattern of adding a 2x2 yellow/orange cross around each non-white cell holds true.  There's no evidence to suggest any variation in the rule based on color or proximity of colored cells.  The rule is consistently applied to each non-white cell independently.  This simplifies the process of generating the output for a given input.\n"
