Yellow and orange pixels are added around the existing colored pixels, creating a cross pattern.\n\n  transformation:\n    - Similar to example 1, yellow and orange pixels are added around the existing colored pixels to form a cross pattern.  The number of colored cells seems to influence the number of crosses, with each colored cell having its own cross. The pattern is consistent and predictable, but the size remains 2x2.\n```\n\n**Revised Thoughts and Observations:**\n\nAfter analyzing both examples, the transformation rule appears more refined.  It seems to involve the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Colored Cells:** Locate all cells with colors other than white (0).\n2. **Create Crosses:** For each colored cell, create a 2x2 cross pattern of yellow and orange pixels centered on the cell. The colors alternate in a specific pattern (as shown in the examples).  The top and bottom of the cross are yellow, and the sides are orange.\n3. **Overlay Crosses:** Overlay the generated crosses onto the original grid.  If crosses overlap, the colors from the overlapping pixels are preserved (as shown in the examples).\n\n\nThe rule consistently uses a 2x2 cross, regardless of the number or position of the colored cells. This makes the transformation highly predictable and deterministic.  The key to solving future puzzles of this type lies in correctly identifying the colored cells and generating the crosses according to the specified color pattern.\n\nTo verify this hypothesis, we need to test it on a new input to see if the output aligns with the predicted transformation.\n"
