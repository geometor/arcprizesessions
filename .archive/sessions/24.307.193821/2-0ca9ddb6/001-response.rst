Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 6), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 6), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  The yellow and orange form a cross pattern around the existing red and blue cells.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve adding yellow and orange pixels around the existing red and blue pixels, creating a cross pattern.  The pattern's size might be related to the distance from the existing colored cells.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation is not simply a geometric operation like mirroring or rotation. It seems to be rule-based, adding new colored blocks based on the positions of existing colored blocks (red and blue).  To understand the rule completely, we'd need more examples to determine if the cross pattern size and color are consistently determined by the location and color of the existing red and blue cells.  A crucial aspect of the rule needs clarification: What determines the dimensions and position of the "cross" around the single colored cells?  Is the "cross" always 2x2?  What if there are multiple colored cells in different locations?  Would multiple crosses appear around the cells, or would there be a different interaction rule?
