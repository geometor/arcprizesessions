The transformation from input to output grids consistently follows a rule-based pattern across all three examples:


#. 
   **Identification of Non-White Cells:** The algorithm first identifies all cells containing a color value other than white (0).

#. 
   **Generation of 2x2 Crosses:** For each non-white cell, a 2x2 cross pattern is generated. This cross consists of yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels arranged as follows:

   .. code-block::

      Y O Y
      O   O
      Y O Y

   where Y represents yellow and O represents orange.  The cross is centered on the non-white cell.

#. 
   **Overlay and Output:** The generated crosses are then overlaid onto the original input grid. The output grid shows the original colors alongside the newly added yellow and orange pixels from the crosses. If crosses overlap, the colors are simply overlaid without modification.

This transformation rule is independent of the number, color, or position of non-white cells in the input. Each non-white cell triggers the creation and overlay of an independent 2x2 cross.  There's no interaction or modification of the rule based on neighboring cells.

The tool's output doesn't perfectly match the example output, highlighting a slight discrepancy in the rule interpretation.  The tool correctly identifies non-zero cells and places the yellow and orange cells around them in the intended pattern. However, the example shows a different arrangement of yellow and orange.  It seems my initial understanding of the pattern may have been slightly off. The example shows a cross shape with yellow at the top and bottom and orange on the sides, while the code implements it with yellow on the top and bottom and orange on the sides.  A more careful examination of the example outputs is necessary to refine the algorithm.  Further analysis is required to resolve this discrepancy. The tool's output should be compared again with the example outputs to accurately describe the pattern.
