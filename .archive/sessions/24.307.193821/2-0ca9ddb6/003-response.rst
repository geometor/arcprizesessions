     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 6: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (7, 3), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (5, 6), color: magenta

     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 6: (1)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (5, 6), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (7, 3), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 4)], color: orange


     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange colors around the existing colored cells.

     transformation:
       - The transformation is consistent with the previous examples.  A 2x2 cross pattern of yellow and orange is added around each cell that is not white. The pattern of yellow and orange remains consistent.

The third example further confirms the hypothesized transformation rule.  The pattern of adding a 2x2 yellow/orange cross around each non-white cell holds true.  There's no evidence to suggest any variation in the rule based on color or proximity of colored cells.  The rule is consistently applied to each non-white cell independently.  This simplifies the process of generating the output for a given input.
