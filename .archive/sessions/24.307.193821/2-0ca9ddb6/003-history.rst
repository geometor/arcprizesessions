Here's an analysis of the provided example, focusing on identifying the transformation from input to output:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 6), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3, 2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6, 6), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange.  The yellow and orange form a cross pattern around the existing red and blue cells.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve adding yellow and orange pixels around the existing red and blue pixels, creating a cross pattern.  The pattern's size might be related to the distance from the existing colored cells.

**Initial Thoughts and Questions:**

The transformation is not simply a geometric operation like mirroring or rotation. It seems to be rule-based, adding new colored blocks based on the positions of existing colored blocks (red and blue).  To understand the rule completely, we'd need more examples to determine if the cross pattern size and color are consistently determined by the location and color of the existing red and blue cells.  A crucial aspect of the rule needs clarification: What determines the dimensions and position of the "cross" around the single colored cells?  Is the "cross" always 2x2?  What if there are multiple colored cells in different locations?  Would multiple crosses appear around the cells, or would there be a different interaction rule?

         - size: 2x2, positions: [(1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2)], color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5)], color: orange
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7)], color: orange
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(0, 5), (0,7), (1, 5), (1,7)], color: orange
         - size: 2x2, positions: [(5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8)], color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange. Yellow and orange pixels are added around the existing colored pixels, creating a cross pattern.

     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, yellow and orange pixels are added around the existing colored pixels to form a cross pattern.  The number of colored cells seems to influence the number of crosses, with each colored cell having its own cross. The pattern is consistent and predictable, but the size remains 2x2.

**Revised Thoughts and Observations:**

After analyzing both examples, the transformation rule appears more refined.  It seems to involve the following steps:


#. **Identify Colored Cells:** Locate all cells with colors other than white (0).
#. **Create Crosses:** For each colored cell, create a 2x2 cross pattern of yellow and orange pixels centered on the cell. The colors alternate in a specific pattern (as shown in the examples).  The top and bottom of the cross are yellow, and the sides are orange.
#. **Overlay Crosses:** Overlay the generated crosses onto the original grid.  If crosses overlap, the colors from the overlapping pixels are preserved (as shown in the examples).

The rule consistently uses a 2x2 cross, regardless of the number or position of the colored cells. This makes the transformation highly predictable and deterministic.  The key to solving future puzzles of this type lies in correctly identifying the colored cells and generating the crosses according to the specified color pattern.

To verify this hypothesis, we need to test it on a new input to see if the output aligns with the predicted transformation.
