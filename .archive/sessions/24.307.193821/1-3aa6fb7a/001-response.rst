001 â€¢ Response
==============

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
         - size: 2, position: adjacent to azure, color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two '0' cells changed to '1' (blue).  These cells are located at the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main azure object.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add a single blue (1) pixel to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main azure (8) object.

My reasoning: The transformation involves adding two blue pixels in specific locations relative to the existing azure block.  There's no change in the size or shape of the main azure object.  The added blue pixels are directly adjacent to the existing azure pixels.
