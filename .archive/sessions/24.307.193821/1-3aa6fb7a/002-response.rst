   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: corners and center of azure, color: blue
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three '0' cells changed to '1' (blue). These cells are located at corners and in the center of the main azure object.
     transformation:
       - Add a blue pixel to each corner and the central location of the azure object.

My reasoning:  Similar to example 1, this example adds blue pixels. However, instead of just the top-right and bottom-left corners of a single block, it adds blue pixels to all four corners and to a point centrally located amongst the existing azure pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels appear to be relative to the overall shape of the azure pixels.
