**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
         - size: 2, position: adjacent to azure, color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two '0' cells changed to '1' (blue).  These cells are located at the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main azure object.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add a single blue (1) pixel to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main azure (8) object.

My reasoning: The transformation involves adding two blue pixels in specific locations relative to the existing azure block.  There's no change in the size or shape of the main azure object.  The added blue pixels are directly adjacent to the existing azure pixels.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: corners and center of azure, color: blue
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three '0' cells changed to '1' (blue). These cells are located at corners and in the center of the main azure object.
     transformation:
       - Add a blue pixel to each corner and the central location of the azure object.

My reasoning:  Similar to example 1, this example adds blue pixels. However, instead of just the top-right and bottom-left corners of a single block, it adds blue pixels to all four corners and to a point centrally located amongst the existing azure pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels appear to be relative to the overall shape of the azure pixels.



**examples summary**



The transformation rule appears to involve adding blue (1) pixels to locations relative to the existing azure (8) pixels.  The specific locations seem to depend on the shape and arrangement of the azure pixels.

Let's summarize the patterns:


* 
  **Example 1:** Adds a blue pixel to the top-right and bottom-left corners of a contiguous block of azure pixels.

* 
  **Example 2:**  Adds a blue pixel to each corner and the center of a scattered group of azure pixels.  The "center" appears to be the centroid or a location near the average of the x and y coordinates of all azure pixels.

To further investigate, I'll use Python code to analyze the coordinates of the added blue pixels and try to identify a consistent pattern.

   # Find coordinates of added blue pixels

   print("Example 1 blue pixel coordinates:", list(zip(example_1_diff[0], example_1_diff[1])))

   #For Example 2, let's compute the centroid of the azure pixels
   azure_coords_ex2 = np.where(example_2_input == 8)
   x_coords_ex2 = azure_coords_ex2[0]
   y_coords_ex2 = azure_coords_ex2[1]
   centroid_x = int(np.mean(x_coords_ex2))
   centroid_y = int(np.mean(y_coords_ex2))
   print("Example 2 centroid:", (centroid_x, centroid_y))



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Example 1 blue pixel coordinates: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4))]
   Example 2 blue pixel coordinates: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3))]
   Example 2 centroid: (2, 3)



The output shows the coordinates of the added blue pixels.  In Example 1, they are indeed at corners of the main azure block. In Example 2, one blue pixel is near the centroid (2,3), while the others are at corners.   The centroid is not exact in Example 2, but close.  This suggests that a refinement to the rule might be necessary.  Perhaps the rule should be: Add blue pixels to corners and a pixel near the centroid of the azure pixels, taking into account the shape and dispersion of the azure group.  If the azure group forms a single connected component, then only corner pixels need to be added.

I need to test this refined rule on new examples to see if it holds.

   test_input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 12
     objects:
       - size: 12, position: scattered, color: azure

Based on the refined rule derived from the analysis of examples 1 and 2, I predict that the output will contain additional blue (1) pixels at the corners and near the centroid of the azure (8) pixels. Let's analyze the locations using Python:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input_array = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                                [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                                [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                                [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                                [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   azure_coords = np.where(test_input_array == 8)
   x_coords = azure_coords[0]
   y_coords = azure_coords[1]
   centroid_x = int(np.mean(x_coords))
   centroid_y = int(np.mean(y_coords))
   print("Centroid:", (centroid_x, centroid_y))

   # Identify corner coordinates (this part requires more sophisticated logic for 
   # arbitrarily shaped groups. A simplification is used here)

   min_x = np.min(x_coords)
   min_y = np.min(y_coords)
   max_x = np.max(x_coords)
   max_y = np.max(y_coords)

   corner_coords = [(min_x, min_y), (min_x, max_y), (max_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)]
   print("Corner coordinates:", corner_coords)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Centroid: (2, 2)
   Corner coordinates: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(6))]



The code identifies the centroid (2,2) and corner coordinates of the scattered azure (8) pixels.  Based on the pattern, I predict that the output will have blue (1) pixels added at these coordinates.  The actual output might be slightly different if the rule isn't perfectly precise near the centroid; the centroid is simply an approximation to help determine a central location.  

Therefore, I predict the output will look like this (Note, this is a prediction based on the observed pattern. To be certain, the actual output needs to be compared against this prediction):



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_output = np.copy(test_input_array)
   test_output[2,2] = 1 #centroid
   test_output[0,0] = 1
   test_output[0,6] = 1
   test_output[6,0] = 1
   test_output[6,6] = 1

   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[1 0 0 0 0 8 1]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 1]]



This is my prediction for the output grid.  I added blue pixels at (2,2) and the four corners [(0,0), (0,6), (6,0), (6,6)].  This prediction is based on my analysis of the previous examples and the refined rule.  The test input's azure block is more scattered than the previous examples.  It would be beneficial to have more examples to refine my rule and handle different shapes and dispersions of the azure blocks more reliably.



**initialize the working output grid:**



================================================================================



INSTRUCTIONS:



use function_call to initialize the working output grid:




* initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output




* initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
