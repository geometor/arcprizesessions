**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5, position: center-left, color: azure
         - size: 2, position: adjacent to azure, color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two '0' cells changed to '1' (blue).  These cells are located at the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main azure object.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add a single blue (1) pixel to the top-right and bottom-left corners of the main azure (8) object.

My reasoning: The transformation involves adding two blue pixels in specific locations relative to the existing azure block.  There's no change in the size or shape of the main azure object.  The added blue pixels are directly adjacent to the existing azure pixels.

     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
     [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 43
         - 8: 7
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 40
         - 8: 7
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: corners and center of azure, color: blue
     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three '0' cells changed to '1' (blue). These cells are located at corners and in the center of the main azure object.
     transformation:
       - Add a blue pixel to each corner and the central location of the azure object.

My reasoning:  Similar to example 1, this example adds blue pixels. However, instead of just the top-right and bottom-left corners of a single block, it adds blue pixels to all four corners and to a point centrally located amongst the existing azure pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels appear to be relative to the overall shape of the azure pixels.
