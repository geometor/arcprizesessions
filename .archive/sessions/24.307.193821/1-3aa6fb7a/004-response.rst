.. code-block:: yaml

   test_input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 12
     objects:
       - size: 12, position: scattered, color: azure

Based on the refined rule derived from the analysis of examples 1 and 2, I predict that the output will contain additional blue (1) pixels at the corners and near the centroid of the azure (8) pixels. Let's analyze the locations using Python:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input_array = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                                [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                                [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                                [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                                [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   azure_coords = np.where(test_input_array == 8)
   x_coords = azure_coords[0]
   y_coords = azure_coords[1]
   centroid_x = int(np.mean(x_coords))
   centroid_y = int(np.mean(y_coords))
   print("Centroid:", (centroid_x, centroid_y))

   # Identify corner coordinates (this part requires more sophisticated logic for 
   # arbitrarily shaped groups. A simplification is used here)

   min_x = np.min(x_coords)
   min_y = np.min(y_coords)
   max_x = np.max(x_coords)
   max_y = np.max(y_coords)

   corner_coords = [(min_x, min_y), (min_x, max_y), (max_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)]
   print("Corner coordinates:", corner_coords)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Centroid: (2, 2)
   Corner coordinates: [(np.int64(0), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(0), np.int64(6)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(0)), (np.int64(6), np.int64(6))]



The code identifies the centroid (2,2) and corner coordinates of the scattered azure (8) pixels.  Based on the pattern, I predict that the output will have blue (1) pixels added at these coordinates.  The actual output might be slightly different if the rule isn't perfectly precise near the centroid; the centroid is simply an approximation to help determine a central location.  

Therefore, I predict the output will look like this (Note, this is a prediction based on the observed pattern. To be certain, the actual output needs to be compared against this prediction):



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_output = np.copy(test_input_array)
   test_output[2,2] = 1 #centroid
   test_output[0,0] = 1
   test_output[0,6] = 1
   test_output[6,0] = 1
   test_output[6,6] = 1

   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[1 0 0 0 0 8 1]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 1]]



This is my prediction for the output grid.  I added blue pixels at (2,2) and the four corners [(0,0), (0,6), (6,0), (6,6)].  This prediction is based on my analysis of the previous examples and the refined rule.  The test input's azure block is more scattered than the previous examples.  It would be beneficial to have more examples to refine my rule and handle different shapes and dispersions of the azure blocks more reliably.
