These cells are located at corners and in the center of the main azure object.\n  transformation:\n    - Add a blue pixel to each corner and the central location of the azure object.\n```\n\nMy reasoning:  Similar to example 1, this example adds blue pixels. However, instead of just the top-right and bottom-left corners of a single block, it adds blue pixels to all four corners and to a point centrally located amongst the existing azure pixels.  The location of the added blue pixels appear to be relative to the overall shape of the azure pixels.\n"
