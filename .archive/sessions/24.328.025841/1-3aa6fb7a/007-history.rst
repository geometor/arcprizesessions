**observations**


    


    

The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a roughly rectangular shape.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels (8) on the perimeter of the cluster have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel are changed to blue.

**observations**


    


    

The input grid in example 2 shows a scattered arrangement of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some of the azure pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  The change seems to follow the same pattern as example 1.

   differences:

     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.

The transformation in example 2 is consistent with example 1: Azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels are changed to blue (1).  The pattern holds true regardless of the initial arrangement of azure pixels.


    


    

**examples summary**


    


    

The transformation rule consistently converts Azure (8) pixels to Blue (1) pixels if and only if they are adjacent to a White (0) pixel.  Adjacency is considered horizontally and vertically, not diagonally.

**observations**


    


    

Here's an analysis of the test input grid, followed by a prediction of the output grid based on the established transformation rule.

**Review Phase**

The test input grid presents a more complex arrangement of azure (8) pixels compared to the examples.  The azure pixels are not clustered together but are scattered across the grid. Several azure pixels appear to be on the perimeter of the structure; some are isolated, while others are grouped together.  The overall shape resembles a distorted letter "L."  The goal is to determine which azure pixels will change to blue (1) based on their adjacency to white (0) pixels.

                      (r < rows - 1 and grid[r + 1, c] == 0) or \
                      (c > 0 and grid[r, c - 1] == 0) or \
                      (c < cols - 1 and grid[r, c + 1] == 0):

The working output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.  This is correct as the transformation only modifies certain pixels, not the entire grid. The code execution cell already contains a function, ``transform_grid``\ , that implements the rule:  Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels change to blue.  The output of that code provides the correct transformed grid, which should now be compared to the working output grid and any discrepancies should be resolved.  There is no need for further code execution to investigate properties; the correctness of the transformation rule has already been verified with the examples.

The working output grid matches the ``test_output`` generated by the ``transform_grid`` function.  Therefore, the working output grid is correct and represents the solution.  No further changes are needed.
