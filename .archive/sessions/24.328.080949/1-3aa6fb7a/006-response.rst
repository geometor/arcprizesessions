The working output grid is currently identical to the test input grid because we haven't yet applied the transformation.  The transformation, as observed in the examples, involves changing some (but not all) azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. The selection of which pixels to change appears random or, at least, non-deterministic based on the provided data.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_grid = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   # Find azure pixels
   azure_indices = np.where(working_grid == 8)
   azure_coords = list(zip(azure_indices[0], azure_indices[1]))
   num_azure = len(azure_coords)

   #Choose approximately half to change (this is a simulation of the apparent randomness)
   num_to_change = num_azure // 2
   random_indices = np.random.choice(num_azure, num_to_change, replace=False)

   # Apply changes
   updated_grid = np.copy(working_grid)
   for i in random_indices:
       row, col = azure_coords[i]
       updated_grid[row, col] = 1

   print("Original Grid:\n", working_grid)
   print("\nUpdated Grid:\n", updated_grid)

code_execution_result: 2

.. code-block::

   Original Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Updated Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
    [8 1 0 0 0 0 8]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

The code above simulates the transformation by randomly selecting approximately half of the azure pixels and changing them to blue.  The resulting ``updated_grid`` is a possible output, keeping in line with the observed pattern in the examples.  Note that because of the random selection, running the code again will produce a different output.  A deterministic solution requires a more precise definition of the transformation rule.  The probabilistic nature of the transformation makes it challenging to predict the exact output without additional information or examples clarifying the selection process.  The current simulation is the best approximation we can make given the data.
