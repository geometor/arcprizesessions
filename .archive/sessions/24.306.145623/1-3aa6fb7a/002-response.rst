**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 7 azure pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (7)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   Same azure cluster as input.
    *   Three blue pixels added.  Each added blue pixel is adjacent to at least one existing azure pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three blue (1) pixels are added.


**Transformation:**

The transformation again involves adding blue (1) pixels.  In this example, three blue pixels are added.  Each new blue pixel is located adjacent to (horizontally or vertically) at least one existing azure pixel.

**Comparison of Examples:**

Both examples demonstrate the addition of blue pixels adjacent to existing azure pixels.  The number of blue pixels added seems to be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster, but more examples are needed to define this relationship precisely.  There's no obvious pattern in *where* specifically the new blue pixels are added beyond the adjacency requirement. The distribution appears somewhat arbitrary within this constraint.


**Overall Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves adding blue pixels to locations adjacent to existing azure pixels. The precise number and location of added pixels likely depend on the size and shape of the azure cluster.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and discover any further underlying rules governing the placement of the new blue pixels.
