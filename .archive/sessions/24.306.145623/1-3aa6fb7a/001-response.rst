Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   Same azure cluster as the input.
    *   Two blue pixels are added. One above and to the right of the azure cluster, and one below and to the right of the azure cluster.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two blue (1) pixels were added to the output.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue pixels.  One blue pixel is added to the upper right and one to the lower right adjacent to the existing azure cluster. The exact location of the new blue pixels relative to the azure cluster is not clear from just one example.  More examples are needed to establish a precise rule.

**Additional Notes:** The relative positions of the added blue pixels (1) seems significant, but more examples are necessary to confirm this.  There might be some kind of adjacency or proximity rule based on the existing pixels.
