**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 6 azure pixels forming an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects:
    *   Same azure cluster as the input.
    *   Two blue pixels are added. One above and to the right of the azure cluster, and one below and to the right of the azure cluster.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two blue (1) pixels were added to the output.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue pixels.  One blue pixel is added to the upper right and one to the lower right adjacent to the existing azure cluster. The exact location of the new blue pixels relative to the azure cluster is not clear from just one example.  More examples are needed to establish a precise rule.

**Additional Notes:** The relative positions of the added blue pixels (1) seems significant, but more examples are necessary to confirm this.  There might be some kind of adjacency or proximity rule based on the existing pixels.

     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
     [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

**observations**

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 7 azure pixels forming an irregular, somewhat L-shaped pattern.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (7)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects:
    *   Same azure cluster as input.
    *   Three blue pixels added.  Each added blue pixel is adjacent to at least one existing azure pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three blue (1) pixels are added.


**Transformation:**

The transformation again involves adding blue (1) pixels.  In this example, three blue pixels are added.  Each new blue pixel is located adjacent to (horizontally or vertically) at least one existing azure pixel.

**Comparison of Examples:**

Both examples demonstrate the addition of blue pixels adjacent to existing azure pixels.  The number of blue pixels added seems to be related to the size or shape of the azure cluster, but more examples are needed to define this relationship precisely.  There's no obvious pattern in *where* specifically the new blue pixels are added beyond the adjacency requirement. The distribution appears somewhat arbitrary within this constraint.


**Overall Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves adding blue pixels to locations adjacent to existing azure pixels. The precise number and location of added pixels likely depend on the size and shape of the azure cluster.  More examples are needed to refine this hypothesis and discover any further underlying rules governing the placement of the new blue pixels.
