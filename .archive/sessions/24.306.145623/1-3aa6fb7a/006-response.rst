The working output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.  This is appropriate given the transformation involves adding pixels rather than completely replacing them.  Let's verify the adjacency and number of added pixels using code.



code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

test_output = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                     [8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])


def count_adjacent(grid, color, x, y):
    count = 0
    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                continue
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= ny < grid.shape[1] and grid[nx, ny] == color:
                count += 1
    return count


diff = test_output - test_input
blue_added_indices = np.where(diff == 1)
num_blues_added = len(blue_added_indices[0])
print(f"Number of blue pixels added: {num_blues_added}")

all_adjacent = True
for r, c in zip(blue_added_indices[0], blue_added_indices[1]):
  if count_adjacent(test_input, 8, r, c) == 0:
    all_adjacent = False
    break

print(f"Are all added blue pixels adjacent to at least one azure pixel?: {all_adjacent}")

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Number of blue pixels added: 6
Are all added blue pixels adjacent to at least one azure pixel?: True
```
The code confirms that 6 blue pixels were added, and all of them are adjacent to at least one azure pixel.  This aligns with the observed pattern in the examples.  The next step is to submit this output as the solution.
