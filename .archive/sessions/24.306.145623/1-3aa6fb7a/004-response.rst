Here's an analysis of the test input and a proposed solution based on the patterns observed in the examples:

**Test Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (31)
    *   8: (12)
*   objects:
    *   A cluster of 12 azure pixels in an irregular shape.


**Proposed Transformation:**

Based on the previous examples, the transformation involves adding blue (1) pixels adjacent to the existing azure (8) pixels. The number of added blue pixels seems to be roughly proportional to the number of azure pixels.  Let's use the code to predict the number of blues and add them strategically.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    azure_count = np.sum(test_input == 8)
    print(f"Number of azure pixels: {azure_count}")
    
    # Based on examples, estimate the number of blue pixels to add. A rough estimate is that the number of added blue pixels is around 1/2 the azure pixels, but it might be more or less.  A simple approximation for now.
    estimated_blue_count = azure_count // 2
    print(f"Estimated number of blue pixels to add: {estimated_blue_count}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Number of azure pixels: 12
Estimated number of blue pixels to add: 6

```

Based on the code's estimate, approximately 6 blue pixels should be added.  The exact placement is somewhat ambiguous, based on previous examples; however, it seems reasonable to try to add the new blue pixels while maintaining adjacency to the existing azure pixels and distributing them as evenly as possible.

**Proposed Output (Step-by-step):**

The most straightforward approach is to use a function that iterates through the grid and adds blue pixels to the adjacent locations of the existing azure pixels, as long as the total of added pixels doesn't exceed the estimated amount.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def add_blue_pixels(grid, num_blues_to_add):
        grid_copy = np.copy(grid)
        blues_added = 0
        for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
            for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
                if grid[r, c] == 8:  # Azure pixel
                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]: # Check adjacent locations
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and grid_copy[nr, nc] == 0 and blues_added < num_blues_to_add:
                            grid_copy[nr, nc] = 1
                            blues_added += 1
        return grid_copy
    
    test_output = add_blue_pixels(test_input, 6)
    print(test_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[1 1 0 0 1 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 1 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

**Final Proposed Output:**

The code produced a reasonable output by adding 6 blue pixels adjacent to azure pixels.  The placement isn't unique, and there could be other valid solutions, but this demonstrates a systematic approach based on the observed patterns.  The function `add_blue_pixels` provides a way to generate possible solutions based on the adjacency rule.  Further refinement might be possible given more examples to better define the placement logic.

**Final Report:**

The analysis of examples 1 and 2 and the test input strongly suggests a transformation rule where blue pixels are added adjacent to existing azure pixels. The number of added blue pixels seems to be correlated with the number of azure pixels, but the exact relationship requires further investigation and potentially more examples.  A reasonable approximation was used to predict the number of blue pixels and add them strategically to an output grid.  The systematic approach of the `add_blue_pixels` function demonstrates a solution method for this type of puzzle.
