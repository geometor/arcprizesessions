Here's an analysis of example 2, followed by a summary comparing both examples and a hypothesis about the transformation rule.

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects: A more spread-out cluster of azure (8) pixels than in Example 1.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects: The azure (8) cluster remains largely intact. Three blue (1) pixels have been added, each in a position adjacent and to the right of an azure (8) pixel.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three white (0) pixels changed to blue (1).


**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, blue (1) pixels are added. However, instead of two, there are now three, each adjacent and to the right of an existing azure (8) pixel.


**Comparison of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples share the core transformation of adding blue (1) pixels adjacent and to the right of azure (8) pixels.  The number of blue pixels added seems to depend on the configuration of the azure (8) cluster. In Example 1, it added two, while in Example 2, it added three.  There is not enough data to definitively state that number of blue pixels added is directly dependent on the number of azure pixels, or is defined by the shape of the cluster.


**Hypothesis about Transformation Rule:**

The transformation rule appears to be: For each azure (8) pixel that has a white (0) pixel directly to its right, add a blue (1) pixel in that location.

**Further Testing:**

More examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to investigate the exact rules governing the placement of blue pixels.  In particular, cases that test the following should be included:

*   Azure (8) pixels with no white (0) pixel to their right.  How does the algorithm handle this situation?
*   Azure (8) pixels with multiple white (0) pixels to their right (horizontally or diagonally).  Does it add a blue (1) pixel for each one?
*   Larger or more complex azure (8) clusters.  Does the pattern hold consistently?

By testing these edge cases, we can refine the transformation rule to better reflect the actual pattern.
