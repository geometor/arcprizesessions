Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (42)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects: A single, somewhat irregularly shaped cluster of azure (8) pixels.


**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (40)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects: The azure (8) cluster from the input remains. Two blue (1) pixels have appeared, one above and to the right of the cluster and one below and to the right of the cluster.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two pixels changed from white (0) to blue (1).


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve adding two blue (1) pixels.  These pixels are located diagonally adjacent and to the right, and in similar positions relative to the cluster of azure (8) pixels.  It seems like a consistent placement relative to the existing cluster, rather than a random placement.  Further examples would help determine the exact placement rules for those two blue pixels.
