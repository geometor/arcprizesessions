The transformation rule appears to be:  For each azure (8) pixel that has a white (0) pixel immediately to its right, a blue (1) pixel is added to that location.


Let's verify this using code:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def transform_grid(grid):
        rows, cols = grid.shape
        new_grid = np.copy(grid)
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r, c] == 8 and c + 1 < cols and grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                    new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1
        return new_grid
    
    # Example 1
    example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    example1_output = transform_grid(example1_input)
    print("Example 1 Transformed Grid:\n", example1_output)
    
    
    # Example 2
    example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                               [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])
    
    example2_output = transform_grid(example2_input)
    print("Example 2 Transformed Grid:\n", example2_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1 Transformed Grid:
 [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 8 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 8 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Example 2 Transformed Grid:
 [[0 0 0 0 8 8 1]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 1]
 [0 0 8 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 8 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 8 1 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]]

```

The code accurately replicates the transformation seen in the examples.  The hypothesis is confirmed: the algorithm adds a blue (1) pixel to the right of each azure (8) pixel if a white (0) pixel is present in that location.  The number of blue pixels added is dependent on the number of azure (8) pixels that meet this condition.
