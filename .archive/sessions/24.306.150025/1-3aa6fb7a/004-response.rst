Here's an analysis of the test input and a predicted output based on the established transformation rule:

**Test Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (35)
    *   8: (12)
*   objects: Multiple clusters of azure (8) pixels.


**Predicted Output:**

Based on the transformation rule ("For each azure (8) pixel that has a white (0) pixel immediately to its right, add a blue (1) pixel in that location"), we can predict the output:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    def transform_grid(grid):
        rows, cols = grid.shape
        new_grid = np.copy(grid)
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r, c] == 8 and c + 1 < cols and grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                    new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1
        return new_grid
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                           [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                           [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                           [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                           [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    test_output = transform_grid(test_input)
    print("Predicted Output:\n", test_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
Predicted Output:
 [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]

```

**Test Output (Predicted):**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (28)
    *   8: (12)
    *   1: (7)
*   objects:  The azure (8) clusters remain, with seven new blue (1) pixels added according to the rule.


**Differences (Predicted):**

*   cells_changed: 7
*   colors_changed: Seven white (0) pixels have been changed to blue (1).

The predicted output reflects the application of the derived transformation rule to the test input.  The next step would be to submit this predicted output for evaluation.
