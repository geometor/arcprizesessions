The working output grid is correctly initialized from the input grid.  The next step is to apply the transformation rule. Let's verify the rule one more time using code and then proceed with applying it to the working grid.

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

def transform_grid(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    new_grid = np.copy(grid)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 8 and c + 1 < cols and grid[r, c + 1] == 0:
                new_grid[r, c + 1] = 1
    return new_grid

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

test_output = transform_grid(test_input)
print("Transformed Grid:\n", test_output)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Transformed Grid:
 [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 8]
 [8 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 1 0]
 [0 8 1 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 0]]
```

The code confirms the transformation rule.  Now let's apply it to the working grid step-by-step.

function_call: set_pixel(1, 1, 1)

result:
set_pixel(1, 1, 1)
**working output grid**
updated with your changes

[[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 1 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]
