            "text": "Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be:  A light blue (8) pixel changes to a blue (1) pixel if it is orthogonally adjacent to a white (0) pixel.  This change only happens to a subset of the light blue pixels that meet this adjacency condition; not all such pixels are changed.  There does not appear to be a consistent pattern dictating which of these pixels are changed, beyond the adjacency rule itself.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis using code.  The code will check for adjacency and predict the output.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    new_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 8:\n                # Check for adjacent white pixels\n                adjacent_white = False\n                if r > 0 and grid[r - 1, c] == 0:\n                    adjacent_white = True\n                if r < rows - 1 and grid[r + 1, c] == 0:\n                    adjacent_white = True\n                if c > 0 and grid[r, c - 1] == 0:\n                    adjacent_white = True\n                if c < cols - 1 and grid[r, c + 1] == 0:\n                    adjacent_white = True\n                \n                #Apply the transformation (only to some adjacent pixels)\n                if adjacent_white:\n                    new_grid[r,c] = 1  \n    return new_grid\n\n\n# Example 1\ninput_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\noutput_grid_1 = transform_grid(input_grid_1)\nprint(\"Example 1 Predicted Output:\\n\", output_grid_1)\n\n# Example 2\ninput_grid_2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])\n\noutput_grid_2 = transform_grid(input_grid_2)\nprint(\"Example 2 Predicted Output:\\n\", output_grid_2)\n\n```\n\ncode_execution_result: 3\n```\nExample 1 Predicted Output:\n [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 8 8 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 8 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nExample 2 Predicted Output:\n [[0 0 0 0 8 8 0]\n [0 0 0 0 1 8 0]\n [0 0 8 1 0 0 0]\n [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]\n```\n\nThe code correctly predicts the output for example 2, but fails for example 1. This suggests that the adjacency rule is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  There is an additional, yet-to-be-determined rule governing which adjacent light blue pixels are actually transformed. More examples are needed to discover this additional rule.  The current code only implements the adjacency condition.  Additional logic would be required to handle the subset of pixels that change.\n"
