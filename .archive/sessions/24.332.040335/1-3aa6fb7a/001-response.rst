Okay, I'm ready to analyze the first example.

**Verbal Description:**

The input grid is a 7x7 grid with a white background (represented by 0) and two groups of azure (represented by 8) pixels. The first group is vertically contiguous, and the second group is horizontally contiguous. The output grid is also 7x7 and is very similar to the input. The difference is that two blue pixels (represented by 1) have been added adjacent to the azure groups. One is to the right of the top azure pixel in the first group and one is to the left of the bottom azure pixel in the second group.

**Code Execution:**
Let's use code to confirm these observations, count the colors, and identify the positions of the azure and added blue pixels.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   output_grid = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   def analyze_grid(grid):
     colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
     color_map = {0: 'white', 1: 'blue', 2: 'red', 3: 'green', 4: 'yellow', 5: 'gray', 6: 'magenta', 7: 'orange', 8: 'azure', 9: 'maroon'}
     color_counts = {color_map[c]: count for c, count in zip(colors, counts)}

     azure_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 8)
     blue_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 1)

     return color_counts, azure_positions.tolist(), blue_positions.tolist()

   input_analysis = analyze_grid(input_grid)
   output_analysis = analyze_grid(output_grid)

   print(f'{input_analysis=}')
   print(f'{output_analysis=}')

.. code-block::

   input_analysis=({'white': np.int64(43), 'azure': np.int64(6)}, [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]], [])
   output_analysis=({'white': np.int64(41), 'blue': np.int64(2), 'azure': np.int64(6)}, [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]], [[1, 2], [4, 4]])






**Review of Findings:**

The code execution confirms our observations:


* The input grid contains white (0) and azure (8) pixels. The output grid has these, plus blue (1) pixels.
* The positions of the azure pixels are the same in both grids.
* The output grid has two blue pixels added at coordinates (1, 2) and (4, 4). These are to the right of the top most azure and to the left of the bottom most azure of each respective group of azure pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

Find all groups of contiguous azure pixels. For each group, identify the top most and bottom most azure pixels. Add a blue pixel to the right of the top most azure pixel. Add a blue pixel to the left of the bottom most azure pixel. If a group has only one azure pixel then add a blue pixel to the right and the left of this single azure pixel. If the first azure pixel is the only azure pixel add a blue to the right and a blue to the left of it.

**Analysis in YAML:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7

     objects:
       - size: 3, position: [1,1]-[2,2], color: azure - vertical group
       - size: 3, position: [3,4]-[4,5], color: azure - horizontal group
   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       0: 41
       1: 2
       8: 6

       - size: 3, position: [3,4]-[4,5], color: azure - horizontal group
       - size: 1, position: [1,2], color: blue - added pixel
       - size: 1, position: [4,4], color: blue - added pixel
   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: added blue
   transformation:
     - Identify groups of contiguous azure pixels.
     - For each group:
       -   Add a blue pixel to the right of the top most azure pixel.
       -   Add a blue pixel to the left of the bottom most azure pixel.
       -   If a group has only one azure pixel then add a blue pixel to the right and the left of this single azure pixel.
