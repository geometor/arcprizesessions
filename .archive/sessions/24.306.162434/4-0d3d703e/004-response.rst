**Example 4**

**Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 9: (3)
  - 4: (3)
  - 2: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
```

**Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 8: (3)
  - 3: (3)
  - 6: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. The mapping is: 9 -> 8, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6.  There is no simple arithmetic relationship.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is again a color replacement, with a unique mapping for this example.

* Maroon (9)  -> Azure (8)
* Yellow (4)  -> Green (3)
* Red (2)     -> Magenta (6)


**Overall Summary of Transformations (after Example 4):**

The pattern remains consistent across all four examples: a color replacement transformation.  However, the mapping between input and output colors is unique to each example.  There is no single, universal formula or rule that governs the color mappings.  Instead, it strongly suggests that the transformation operates based on a lookup table that is specific to each input grid.  Each example's transformation is independent, defined by a unique color-to-color mapping.  The size and arrangement of the grid remain constant.  There is no spatial or geometric transformation.  The task is purely about transforming each color independently.
