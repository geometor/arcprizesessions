The transformation applied in all four examples is a color replacement, where each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid.  Crucially, the mapping is *unique* to each example; there is no single, consistent mathematical function or rule governing the transformation.  Instead, each example appears to use a separate, independent lookup table to define its specific color mapping.

The size and arrangement of the grid (3x3) remain constant; the transformation only affects the color of each cell. No spatial or geometric transformations (rotation, mirroring, etc.) are involved. The task is strictly about replacing colors according to a per-example lookup table.  There are no apparent patterns in how the colors are mapped that extend between examples; each mapping is independent and seemingly arbitrary.

Here's a code illustration demonstrating the independent mappings:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    example_mappings = {
        1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6},  # Example 1
        2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9},  # Example 2
        3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2},  # Example 3
        4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6},  # Example 4
    }
    
    print("Example Mappings:")
    for example_num, mapping in example_mappings.items():
        print(f"Example {example_num}: {mapping}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example Mappings:
Example 1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}
Example 2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}
Example 3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}
Example 4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}

```

This code clearly shows that each example has a unique mapping, confirming the observation that there isn't a generalizable formula or rule beyond a per-example color substitution.  Predicting the output for a new input requires knowing its specific mapping.  There is no discernible pattern in how these mappings are generated.
