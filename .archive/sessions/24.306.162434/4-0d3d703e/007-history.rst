**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 3: (3)
  - 1: (3)
  - 2: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
```

**Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 4: (3)
  - 5: (3)
  - 6: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta

```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  There's a consistent mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.  The mapping appears to be a simple addition of 1 to each original color value.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of colors based on a consistent mapping.  Each color in the input is replaced with a specific, different color in the output. The mapping is:

* Green (3)  -> Yellow (4)
* Blue (1)   -> Gray (5)
* Red (2)    -> Magenta (6)

This suggests a simple numerical mapping of colors, rather than a spatial or pattern-based transformation.  It's a direct color substitution.

**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 2: (3)
  - 3: (3)
  - 8: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: azure
```

**Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 6: (3)
  - 4: (3)
  - 9: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: maroon
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. The mapping is: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9.  There is no simple arithmetic progression as in Example 1.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is again a color replacement, but the mapping isn't a simple arithmetic progression like adding a constant. The mapping is more complex:

* Red (2)    -> Magenta (6)
* Green (3)  -> Yellow (4)
* Azure (8)  -> Maroon (9)

This suggests a more complex, possibly lookup-table based transformation where each input color has a pre-defined output color.  There is no readily apparent mathematical formula.  The mappings may not be directly related but instead represent a sort of color permutation or substitution.

  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
```

**Output:**

```

  - 1: (3)
  - 9: (3)
  - 2: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  The mapping is: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2. There's no simple arithmetic relation.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is again a color replacement with a complex, non-arithmetic mapping:

* Gray (5)   -> Blue (1)
* Azure (8)  -> Maroon (9)
* Magenta (6) -> Red (2)

This reinforces the hypothesis of a complex, potentially lookup-table-based transformation. Each input color is mapped to a distinct output color, without a simple mathematical relationship between the input and output values.  The transformation appears to be a permutation of the colors.

**Overall Summary of Transformations:**

Across all three examples, the transformation consistently involves a color replacement.  However, the mappings between input and output colors are different for each example. There's no single, simple formula or rule that applies universally.  The most plausible explanation is a lookup table where each input color is mapped to a specific output color, and these mappings change across different puzzles.  Further analysis is needed to definitively determine the nature of this lookup table or whether there's a more subtle pattern at play.

```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. The mapping is: 9 -> 8, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6.  There is no simple arithmetic relationship.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is again a color replacement, with a unique mapping for this example.

* Maroon (9)  -> Azure (8)
* Yellow (4)  -> Green (3)
* Red (2)     -> Magenta (6)


**Overall Summary of Transformations (after Example 4):**

The pattern remains consistent across all four examples: a color replacement transformation.  However, the mapping between input and output colors is unique to each example.  There is no single, universal formula or rule that governs the color mappings.  Instead, it strongly suggests that the transformation operates based on a lookup table that is specific to each input grid.  Each example's transformation is independent, defined by a unique color-to-color mapping.  The size and arrangement of the grid remain constant.  There is no spatial or geometric transformation.  The task is purely about transforming each color independently.

**examples summary**

The transformation applied in all four examples is a color replacement, where each color in the input grid is mapped to a different color in the output grid.  Crucially, the mapping is *unique* to each example; there is no single, consistent mathematical function or rule governing the transformation.  Instead, each example appears to use a separate, independent lookup table to define its specific color mapping.

The size and arrangement of the grid (3x3) remain constant; the transformation only affects the color of each cell. No spatial or geometric transformations (rotation, mirroring, etc.) are involved. The task is strictly about replacing colors according to a per-example lookup table.  There are no apparent patterns in how the colors are mapped that extend between examples; each mapping is independent and seemingly arbitrary.

Here's a code illustration demonstrating the independent mappings:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    example_mappings = {
        1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6},  # Example 1
        2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9},  # Example 2
        3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2},  # Example 3
        4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6},  # Example 4
    }
    
    print("Example Mappings:")
    for example_num, mapping in example_mappings.items():
        print(f"Example {example_num}: {mapping}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example Mappings:
Example 1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}
Example 2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}
Example 3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}
Example 4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}

```

This code clearly shows that each example has a unique mapping, confirming the observation that there isn't a generalizable formula or rule beyond a per-example color substitution.  Predicting the output for a new input requires knowing its specific mapping.  There is no discernible pattern in how these mappings are generated.

**test**

    [[8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]
     [8 1 3]]


.. image:: _images/005-test_input.png
   :alt: _images/005-test_input.png


**observations**

Based on the analysis of the provided examples, the transformation appears to be a per-example color mapping. There is no consistent mathematical relationship between input and output colors across different examples. Each example seems to have its unique lookup table determining the color transformation.

Let's analyze the test input and predict the output based on this observation:

**Test Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 8: (3)
  - 1: (3)
  - 3: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0, 0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (0, 1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (0, 2), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (1, 0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (1, 1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (1, 2), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (2, 0), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2, 1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (2, 2), color: green
```

To predict the output, we need to identify a new mapping for this test case.  Since there is no apparent pattern in how the previous mappings were created, it is impossible to predict the mapping with certainty.  To solve this, we would need additional examples or information to create a rule that maps colors in this test case.


Let's assume, for the sake of demonstration, that the test case mapping was somehow determined (perhaps through external means, or more example data), resulting in the following color mapping:

* Azure (8)  -> Magenta (6)
* Blue (1)   -> Yellow (4)
* Green (3)  -> Gray (5)

Then, the predicted output would be:

**Predicted Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 6: (3)
  - 4: (3)
  - 5: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0, 0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (0, 1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (0, 2), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (1, 0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1, 1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (1, 2), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (2, 0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2, 1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (2, 2), color: gray

```

**Conclusion:**

Without a pattern or rule to determine the specific color mapping for the test input, accurate prediction is impossible. The puzzle highlights the lack of generalizability in the transformations presented across the four examples.  More information, perhaps in the form of additional examples, is needed to solve the test case reliably.  The key characteristic of the transformation is the unique mapping of input to output colors per instance.  This suggests a process driven by an unspecified lookup table rather than a generalized function.

**initialize the working output grid:**

<instructions>

use function_call to initialize the working output grid:

- initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between input and output

- initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color

<\instructions>
