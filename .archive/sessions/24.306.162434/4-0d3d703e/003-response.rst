**Example 3**

**Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 5: (3)
  - 8: (3)
  - 6: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
```

**Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 1: (3)
  - 9: (3)
  - 2: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  The mapping is: 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2. There's no simple arithmetic relation.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is again a color replacement with a complex, non-arithmetic mapping:

* Gray (5)   -> Blue (1)
* Azure (8)  -> Maroon (9)
* Magenta (6) -> Red (2)

This reinforces the hypothesis of a complex, potentially lookup-table-based transformation. Each input color is mapped to a distinct output color, without a simple mathematical relationship between the input and output values.  The transformation appears to be a permutation of the colors.

**Overall Summary of Transformations:**

Across all three examples, the transformation consistently involves a color replacement.  However, the mappings between input and output colors are different for each example. There's no single, simple formula or rule that applies universally.  The most plausible explanation is a lookup table where each input color is mapped to a specific output color, and these mappings change across different puzzles.  Further analysis is needed to definitively determine the nature of this lookup table or whether there's a more subtle pattern at play.
