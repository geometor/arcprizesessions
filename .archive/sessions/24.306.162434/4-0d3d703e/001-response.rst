Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 3: (3)
  - 1: (3)
  - 2: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: blue
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: red
```

**Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 4: (3)
  - 5: (3)
  - 6: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: gray
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta

```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  There's a consistent mapping: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.  The mapping appears to be a simple addition of 1 to each original color value.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of colors based on a consistent mapping.  Each color in the input is replaced with a specific, different color in the output. The mapping is:

* Green (3)  -> Yellow (4)
* Blue (1)   -> Gray (5)
* Red (2)    -> Magenta (6)

This suggests a simple numerical mapping of colors, rather than a spatial or pattern-based transformation.  It's a direct color substitution.
