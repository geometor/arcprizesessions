**Example 2**

**Input:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 2: (3)
  - 3: (3)
  - 8: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: azure
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: red
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: green
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: azure
```

**Output:**

```
width: 3
height: 3
colors:
  - 6: (3)
  - 4: (3)
  - 9: (3)
objects:
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (0,2), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: maroon
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,0), color: magenta
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
  - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: maroon
```

**Differences:**

```
cells_changed: 9
colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors. The mapping is: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9.  There is no simple arithmetic progression as in Example 1.
```

**Transformation:**

The transformation is again a color replacement, but the mapping isn't a simple arithmetic progression like adding a constant. The mapping is more complex:

* Red (2)    -> Magenta (6)
* Green (3)  -> Yellow (4)
* Azure (8)  -> Maroon (9)

This suggests a more complex, possibly lookup-table based transformation where each input color has a pre-defined output color.  There is no readily apparent mathematical formula.  The mappings may not be directly related but instead represent a sort of color permutation or substitution.
