**example_3**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (73)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 6: (1)
  objects:
    - single red (2) at (2, 2)
    - single blue (1) at (7, 3)
    - single magenta (6) at (5, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (65)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 6: (1)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red (2) at (2, 2)
    - single blue (1) at (7, 3)
    - single magenta (6) at (5, 6)
    - yellow (4) forming a cross around the red pixel
    - orange (7) forming an L shape around the blue pixel

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 8
  colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively, forming the same pattern as before.

**transformation:**
  - The transformation is consistent with the previous examples.  Yellow (4) pixels are added in a cross pattern around the red (2) pixel and orange (7) pixels are added in an "L" pattern around the blue (1) pixel. The magenta (6) pixel remains unchanged.


**Summary of Observations across all examples:**

The core transformation consistently involves:

1.  **Identifying "seed" pixels:** Pixels with values 1 (blue) and 2 (red) are identified as seeds.
2.  **Expanding around seeds:**  A cross pattern of yellow (4) pixels is added around red (2) seeds and an L shape pattern of orange (7) pixels is added around blue (1) seeds.
3.  **Pattern consistency:** The orientation and dimensions of the cross and L shapes are consistent across all examples.
4.  **No interaction between expansions:** The expanded patterns do not overlap or influence each other, even if seeds are close together.
5.  **Other colors are unaffected:** Other colors (e.g., magenta, azure) remain unchanged.

Based on these observations, a robust algorithm can now be designed to predict the output for new inputs.  The algorithm would need to:

1.  Scan the input grid to find all pixels with value 1 and 2.
2.  For each pixel with value 1, add an "L" shape of orange (7) pixels.
3.  For each pixel with value 2, add a cross shape of yellow (4) pixels.
4.  The sizes and orientations of the L and cross shapes should be consistent across examples.
5.  Handle edge cases appropriately—e.g., if the pattern would extend beyond the grid boundary.

This refined description allows for a clearer specification of the transformation rule and aids in constructing a more effective solution algorithm.
