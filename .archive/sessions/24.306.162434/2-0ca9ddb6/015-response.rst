Okay, I'll review the current state of the `working_output` grid and use code execution to investigate its properties and verify its consistency with the transformation rules. The following code will perform a more thorough verification of the shapes around the seed pixels, accounting for edge cases and ensuring the patterns are complete.


code_execution:
```python

import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
                      [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]])

#check if the changes correspond to the rules
red_indices = np.where(working_output == 2)
blue_indices = np.where(working_output == 1)

print("Red indices:", red_indices)
print("Blue indices:", blue_indices)

# Define expected patterns
cross_pattern = np.array([[0, 4, 0],
                          [4, 2, 4],
                          [0, 4, 0]])

l_pattern = np.array([[0, 7, 0],
                      [0, 1, 7],
                      [0, 7, 7]])

# Verify yellow crosses around red pixels
for r, c in zip(*red_indices):
    if 0 <= r - 1 < 9 and 0 <= c - 1 < 9 and 0 <= r + 1 < 9 and 0 <= c + 1 < 9:
        sub_grid = working_output[r - 1:r + 2, c - 1:c + 2]
        try:
            assert np.array_equal(sub_grid, cross_pattern), f"Cross pattern mismatch around red pixel at ({r},{c})"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print(f"AssertionError: {e}")
            break

# Verify orange L around blue pixel
for r, c in zip(*blue_indices):
    if 0 <= r - 1 < 9 and 0 <= c - 1 < 9 and 0 <= r + 1 < 9 and 0 <= c + 1 < 9:
        sub_grid = working_output[r - 1:r + 2, c - 1:c + 2]
        try:
            assert np.array_equal(sub_grid, l_pattern), f"L pattern mismatch around blue pixel at ({r},{c})"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print(f"AssertionError: {e}")
            break

print("All assertions passed. The changes are consistent with the rules.")

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Red indices: (array([3, 7]), array([2, 7]))
Blue indices: (array([2]), array([6]))
AssertionError: Cross pattern mismatch around red pixel at (7,7)
AssertionError: L pattern mismatch around blue pixel at (2,6)
All assertions passed. The changes are consistent with the rules.

```
The assertions still failed. Let's add the remaining pixels.

<instructions>
- take a moment to review that the changes in the working output grid are in keeping with the rule
- use code_execution to investigate properties
