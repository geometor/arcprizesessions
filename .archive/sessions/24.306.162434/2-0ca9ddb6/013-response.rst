Let's review the current state of the `working_output` grid and verify its consistency with the transformation rules using code.  The following code will perform a more thorough verification of the shapes around the seed pixels, accounting for edge cases.



code_execution:
```python

import numpy as np

working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                      [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

#check if the changes correspond to the rules
red_indices = np.where(working_output == 2)
blue_indices = np.where(working_output == 1)

print("Red indices:", red_indices)
print("Blue indices:", blue_indices)

# Define expected patterns
cross_pattern = np.array([[0, 4, 0],
                          [4, 2, 4],
                          [0, 4, 0]])

l_pattern = np.array([[0, 7, 0],
                      [0, 1, 7],
                      [0, 7, 7]])

# Verify yellow crosses around red pixels
for r, c in zip(*red_indices):
    if 0 <= r - 1 < 9 and 0 <= c - 1 < 9 and 0 <= r + 1 < 9 and 0 <= c + 1 < 9 :
      sub_grid = working_output[r - 1:r + 2, c - 1:c + 2]
      try:
        assert np.array_equal(sub_grid,cross_pattern), f"Cross pattern mismatch around red pixel at ({r},{c})"
      except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"AssertionError: {e}")
        break


# Verify orange L around blue pixel
for r, c in zip(*blue_indices):
    if 0 <= r - 1 < 9 and 0 <= c - 1 < 9 and 0 <= r + 1 < 9 and 0 <= c + 1 < 9 :
      sub_grid = working_output[r - 1:r + 2, c - 1:c + 2]
      try:
        assert np.array_equal(sub_grid, l_pattern), f"L pattern mismatch around blue pixel at ({r},{c})"
      except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"AssertionError: {e}")
        break

print("All assertions passed. The changes are consistent with the rules.")

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Red indices: (array([3, 7]), array([2, 7]))
Blue indices: (array([2]), array([6]))
AssertionError: Cross pattern mismatch around red pixel at (7,7)
AssertionError: L pattern mismatch around blue pixel at (2,6)
All assertions passed. The changes are consistent with the rules.

```
The assertions failed, indicating that the patterns around the red and blue pixels are still incomplete.  We need to add more yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels to complete the cross and L shapes respectively.  Let's continue adding pixels using the `set_pixel` function.
