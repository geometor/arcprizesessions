Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (73)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
  objects:
    - single red (2) at (3, 2)
    - single blue (1) at (6, 6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (61)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (1)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (4)
  objects:
    - single red (2) at (3, 2)
    - single blue (1) at (6, 6)
    - yellow (4) forming a cross around the red pixel
    - orange (7) forming an L shape around the blue pixel


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 12
  colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels respectively, forming a specific pattern.

**transformation:**
  - The core transformation involves adding yellow and orange pixels around the initial red and blue pixels, respectively.  The patterns seem to follow a specific geometrical arrangement. The yellow pixels create a cross shape and the orange pixels form an "L" shape.

**Additional Notes:**

The transformation is not simply a matter of adding pixels of specific colours around the existing ones.  It appears to be spatially specific in terms of which cells are chosen. It looks like an expansion of an existing object creating a new shape with a different color. The red and blue pixels appear to act as seeds or centers for the growth of these new patterns. More examples are needed to confirm these hypothesis and determine if there are other rules involved.
