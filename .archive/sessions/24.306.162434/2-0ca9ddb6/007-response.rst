The working output grid is correctly initialized from the input grid.  Let's proceed to add the predicted changes using code.

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    # Add yellow crosses around red pixels
    working_output[2:4, 2] = 4  #vertical
    working_output[3, 1:3] = 4  #horizontal
    
    working_output[6:8, 7] = 4  #vertical
    working_output[7, 6:8] = 4 #horizontal
    
    
    # Add orange L around blue pixel
    working_output[2:4, 6] = 7
    working_output[3, 5:7] =7
    
    
    print(working_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 0 7 0 0]
 [0 4 4 0 0 7 7 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]
 [0 6 0 0 0 0 4 4 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

```

The code correctly implements the transformation rules.  The resulting `working_output` matches the predicted output.  The azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged, while yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels are added according to the previously established rules.  The only slight difference is that the code does not handle edge cases that might result in extending patterns beyond the grid boundaries.  However, that wasn't necessary for this example.  The solution is complete.
