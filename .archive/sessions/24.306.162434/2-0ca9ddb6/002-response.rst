**example_2**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (66)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (2)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single azure (8) at (0,3)
    - two red (2) at (2,6), (7,1)
    - two blue (1) at (3,2), (6,6)

**output:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (50)
    - 1: (2)
    - 2: (2)
    - 4: (4)
    - 7: (12)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single azure (8) at (0,3)
    - two red (2) at (2,6), (7,1)
    - two blue (1) at (3,2), (6,6)
    - yellow (4) forming a cross around the red pixel
    - orange (7) forming an L shape around the blue pixel


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 20
  colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels around the existing red and blue pixels, forming specific patterns.

**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, this example shows the addition of yellow and orange pixels around the red and blue pixels, respectively. The yellow pixels again form a cross shape, and the orange pixels an "L" shape.  The pattern extends to multiple red and blue pixels independently.

**Summary of Transformations:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule appears to be as follows:

1. **Identify seed pixels:** The algorithm identifies pixels with values 1 (blue) and 2 (red).
2. **Expand around blue pixels:** Around each blue (1) pixel, it adds orange (7) pixels forming an "L" shape.  The L shape is consistently oriented in the same way relative to the blue pixel.
3. **Expand around red pixels:**  Around each red (2) pixel, it adds yellow (4) pixels in a cross shape.  The cross extends equal distance in all four directions.
4. **No overlap:** The new shapes do not overlap with existing pixels or each other.


**Further testing required:**

More examples are needed to confirm the following:

*   **Consistency:** Do the patterns of the L shape and the cross shape always remain the same?
*   **Edge handling:** What happens if a seed pixel is near the edge of the grid? Are the patterns truncated, or do they extend beyond the grid?
*   **Multiple seeds:** Do the expanded patterns interact or overlap if two seed pixels are close together?
*   **Other colors:**  Are other colors treated similarly?  Would a green or magenta pixel generate an expansion? What shape and color would be used?

These questions need to be answered before a robust solution algorithm can be developed.
