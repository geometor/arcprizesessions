Here's a report analyzing the test input and predicting the output based on the patterns observed in the examples:

**Test Input Analysis**

**input:**
  width: 9
  height: 9
  colors:
    - 0: (68)
    - 1: (1)
    - 2: (2)
    - 6: (1)
    - 8: (1)
  objects:
    - single blue (1) at (2,6)
    - two red (2) at (3,2), (7,7)
    - single magenta (6) at (7,1)
    - single azure (8) at (5,5)

Based on the established transformation rules:

1.  Around each blue (1) pixel, add an "L" shape of orange (7) pixels.
2.  Around each red (2) pixel, add a cross shape of yellow (4) pixels.
3.  Other colors (magenta, azure) remain unchanged.



**Predicted Output**

To predict the output, let's manually apply these rules:

- **Blue (1) at (2,6):** The L-shape of orange (7) will extend to (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), and (3,5).
- **Red (2) at (3,2):** The cross of yellow (4) will extend to (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), and (3,3).
- **Red (2) at (7,7):** The cross of yellow (4) will extend to (6,7), (8,7), (7,6), and (7,8).

Therefore, the predicted output grid will be:

code_execution:


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    
    predicted_output = np.copy(test_input)
    
    #add yellow crosses around red pixels
    predicted_output[2,2] = 4
    predicted_output[4,2] = 4
    predicted_output[3,1] = 4
    predicted_output[3,3] = 4
    
    predicted_output[6,7] = 4
    predicted_output[8,7] = 4
    predicted_output[7,6] = 4
    predicted_output[7,8] = 4
    
    
    #add orange L around blue pixel
    predicted_output[3,6] = 7
    predicted_output[3,7] = 7
    predicted_output[4,7] = 7
    predicted_output[3,5] = 7
    
    print(predicted_output)

code_execution_result: 1

```
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0]
 [0 4 2 4 0 7 7 7 0]
 [0 0 4 0 0 0 0 7 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]
 [0 6 0 0 0 0 4 2 4]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0]]

```

This is the predicted output.  The azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged.  The expansion patterns around the blue and red pixels match the observed patterns in the examples.  The predicted output grid represents the solution according to the identified transformation rules.  Note:  The code assumes the expansion patterns (cross and L-shape) have a consistent size and orientation relative to the seed pixels.  More examples would provide additional confidence in this aspect of the rule.
