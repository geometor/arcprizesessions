**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 10
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (62) white
    *   5: (18) gray
*   objects: A single, roughly irregular gray blob, somewhat resembling an arrowhead shape.


**Output:**

*   width: 10
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (62) white
    *   2: (7) red
    *   8: (11) azure
*   objects:  The gray blob is transformed into a similar-shaped blob using red and azure.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 18
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by azure (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining the general shape of the original gray blob.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is very similar to Example 1.  Gray pixels are again replaced with a combination of azure and red, preserving the overall shape.  The pattern of red and azure placement seems to depend on the original gray blob's structure.  The distribution of red and azure within the new blob doesn't appear completely random.

**Combined Observations (Examples 1 & 2):**

Both examples demonstrate a transformation where a gray blob is replaced by a similar-shaped blob using azure and red.  The distribution of azure and red seems somewhat algorithmic and related to the structure/adjacency of the original gray pixels.  The algorithm is not yet clear, but further examples should help reveal the pattern.  It's likely a rule based on neighboring gray pixels, perhaps involving some kind of iterative process or pattern recognition.
