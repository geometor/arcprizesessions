Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 11
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (70) white
    *   5: (17) gray
*   objects: A single, roughly irregular gray blob.

**Output:**

*   width: 11
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (70) white
    *   2: (7) red
    *   8: (17) azure
*   objects: The gray blob is transformed into a similar-shaped blob composed of red and azure.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 17
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) is replaced with azure (8) and red (2).  The replacement maintains the general shape of the gray blob, but with a change in the internal structure.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray (5) pixels with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels while largely preserving the shape and connectedness of the original gray blob.  A potential rule might be: Gray pixels are replaced based on their adjacency to other gray pixels in the input. Further examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.  There seems to be a pattern or algorithm that determines how much red (2) vs. azure (8) are used.

I need more examples to verify this hypothesis and to understand the algorithm governing the distribution of red and azure pixels.
