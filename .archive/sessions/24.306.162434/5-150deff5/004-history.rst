**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 11
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (70) white
    *   5: (17) gray
*   objects: A single, roughly irregular gray blob.

**Output:**

*   width: 11
*   height: 9
*   colors:
    *   0: (70) white
    *   2: (7) red
    *   8: (17) azure
*   objects: The gray blob is transformed into a similar-shaped blob composed of red and azure.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 17
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) is replaced with azure (8) and red (2).  The replacement maintains the general shape of the gray blob, but with a change in the internal structure.


**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve a replacement of the gray (5) pixels with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels while largely preserving the shape and connectedness of the original gray blob.  A potential rule might be: Gray pixels are replaced based on their adjacency to other gray pixels in the input. Further examples are needed to refine this hypothesis.  There seems to be a pattern or algorithm that determines how much red (2) vs. azure (8) are used.

I need more examples to verify this hypothesis and to understand the algorithm governing the distribution of red and azure pixels.

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 10
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (62) white
    *   5: (18) gray
*   objects: A single, roughly irregular gray blob, somewhat resembling an arrowhead shape.


**Output:**

*   width: 10
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (62) white
    *   2: (7) red
    *   8: (11) azure
*   objects:  The gray blob is transformed into a similar-shaped blob using red and azure.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 18
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by azure (8) and red (2) pixels, maintaining the general shape of the original gray blob.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is very similar to Example 1.  Gray pixels are again replaced with a combination of azure and red, preserving the overall shape.  The pattern of red and azure placement seems to depend on the original gray blob's structure.  The distribution of red and azure within the new blob doesn't appear completely random.

**Combined Observations (Examples 1 & 2):**

Both examples demonstrate a transformation where a gray blob is replaced by a similar-shaped blob using azure and red.  The distribution of azure and red seems somewhat algorithmic and related to the structure/adjacency of the original gray pixels.  The algorithm is not yet clear, but further examples should help reveal the pattern.  It's likely a rule based on neighboring gray pixels, perhaps involving some kind of iterative process or pattern recognition.

**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (58) white
    *   5: (12) gray
*   objects: A gray blob, somewhat irregular and resembling a sideways "L" shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (58) white
    *   2: (5) red
    *   8: (7) azure
*   objects: The gray blob is transformed into a similar "L"-shaped blob using red and azure pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 12
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by red (2) and azure (8) pixels, maintaining the general "L" shape of the original blob.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the previous examples. Gray pixels are replaced with a mix of red and azure, keeping the original shape.  The distribution of red and azure seems related to adjacency. There's a preference for red near the 'corner' and azure near the 'base' but this could be coincidence.



**Combined Observations (Examples 1, 2, & 3):**

All three examples show a consistent transformation:

1.  **Shape Preservation:** The shape of the gray blob in the input is largely maintained in the output.
2.  **Color Replacement:** Gray (5) pixels are replaced with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Algorithmic Replacement:** The placement of red and azure isn't random. It seems to follow a pattern related to the position and adjacency of the original gray pixels.  The pattern is not fully clear but might involve some adjacency rules and potentially a positional bias.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation likely involves an algorithm that iterates through the gray pixels. For each gray pixel, it considers the adjacent pixels (and potentially more distant ones) to determine whether to replace it with red or azure.  The precise rules for this determination are not fully known, but it might incorporate factors like the number of adjacent gray pixels and their spatial arrangement.  There might also be a precedence/bias of using red for a certain portion of the blob and azure for another portion.

To determine the precise algorithm, more examples are needed, especially examples with different shapes and sizes of the gray blob and those that might reveal patterns in the distribution of red and azure pixels within the resulting object.
