**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (58) white
    *   5: (12) gray
*   objects: A gray blob, somewhat irregular and resembling a sideways "L" shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 9
*   height: 8
*   colors:
    *   0: (58) white
    *   2: (5) red
    *   8: (7) azure
*   objects: The gray blob is transformed into a similar "L"-shaped blob using red and azure pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 12
*   colors_changed: Gray (5) pixels are replaced by red (2) and azure (8) pixels, maintaining the general "L" shape of the original blob.


**Transformation:**

The transformation is consistent with the previous examples. Gray pixels are replaced with a mix of red and azure, keeping the original shape.  The distribution of red and azure seems related to adjacency. There's a preference for red near the 'corner' and azure near the 'base' but this could be coincidence.



**Combined Observations (Examples 1, 2, & 3):**

All three examples show a consistent transformation:

1.  **Shape Preservation:** The shape of the gray blob in the input is largely maintained in the output.
2.  **Color Replacement:** Gray (5) pixels are replaced with a combination of red (2) and azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Algorithmic Replacement:** The placement of red and azure isn't random. It seems to follow a pattern related to the position and adjacency of the original gray pixels.  The pattern is not fully clear but might involve some adjacency rules and potentially a positional bias.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The transformation likely involves an algorithm that iterates through the gray pixels. For each gray pixel, it considers the adjacent pixels (and potentially more distant ones) to determine whether to replace it with red or azure.  The precise rules for this determination are not fully known, but it might incorporate factors like the number of adjacent gray pixels and their spatial arrangement.  There might also be a precedence/bias of using red for a certain portion of the blob and azure for another portion.

To determine the precise algorithm, more examples are needed, especially examples with different shapes and sizes of the gray blob and those that might reveal patterns in the distribution of red and azure pixels within the resulting object.
