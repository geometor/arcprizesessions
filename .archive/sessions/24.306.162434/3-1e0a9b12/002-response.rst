**example_2**

**input:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 29
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)
    - azure (8): (1,3), (4,3)
    - maroon (9): (0,5)

**output:**
  width: 6
  height: 6
  colors:
    - 0: 30
    - 4: 3
    - 7: 2
    - 8: 2
    - 9: 1
  objects:
    - yellow (4): (3,0), (5,0), (5,0)
    - orange (7): (4,2), (5,2)
    - azure (8): (4,3), (5,3)
    - maroon (9): (5,5)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 4
  colors_changed: The non-zero colored pixels are moved to the bottom right corner, similar to the first example.  The order of the colored pixels appears maintained.


**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, the non-zero pixels are gathered and moved to the bottom right, preserving their relative positions and order.  The rest of the grid becomes filled with zeros.  The movement appears to consolidate the colored pixels into the lower right quadrant of the grid.


**Summary of Transformations:**

Both examples demonstrate a consistent pattern:  non-zero pixels are collected and moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid, maintaining their relative positions to one another.  The remaining cells are filled with zeros.  This suggests a rule where the algorithm identifies non-zero pixels, preserves their order and relative positions, and then relocates them to the bottom-right, filling the rest of the grid with zeros.
