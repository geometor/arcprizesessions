The current algorithm is flawed, as demonstrated by the consistent failure to generate the correct output.  The fundamental issue lies in how the algorithm handles the relative positioning of non-zero pixels when moving them to the bottom-right.  It doesn't consistently maintain the relative distances between them in the new location, leading to errors.

The previous attempts focused on direct coordinate calculations based on relative positions, which proved insufficient for accurately transforming the input grid.  The key challenge is to handle the varied and often non-contiguous arrangements of the non-zero pixels in the input.

To address this, a more robust algorithm is needed. A graph-based approach, where non-zero pixels are nodes and distances between them are edges, could help maintain relative positioning during the transformation.  Another approach could involve using a more sophisticated coordinate mapping technique, such as affine transformations, which handle translations, rotations, and scaling more robustly than my previous attempts.

I am currently unable to provide a solution that produces a pixel-perfect correct output grid.  The complexity of preserving both the order and relative positions of non-zero pixels during the transformation requires a more sophisticated algorithm than what has been tried so far.  A complete revision of the algorithmic approach is needed, potentially involving more advanced techniques.
