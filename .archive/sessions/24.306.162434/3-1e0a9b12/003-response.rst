**example_3**

**input:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 18
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (3,3), (2,3)
    - red (2): (2,4)
    - green (3): (1,1), (2,1), (4,1)
    - magenta (6): (3,0)

**output:**
  width: 5
  height: 5
  colors:
    - 0: 20
    - 1: 2
    - 2: 1
    - 3: 3
    - 6: 1
  objects:
    - blue (1): (3,3), (4,3)
    - red (2): (4,4)
    - green (3): (2,2), (3,2), (4,1)
    - magenta (6): (4,0)

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 7
  colors_changed:  The non-zero pixels are moved toward the bottom-right, similar to the previous examples, but the movement isn't a strict bottom-right corner collection.  There's a slight shift and rearrangement.


**transformation:**
  - The transformation again involves moving the non-zero pixels towards the bottom right, but the movement and arrangement seem less strictly defined than in the first two examples. The pixels are consolidated in the lower right quadrant.

**Ruminate Phase:**

The transformation observed across all three examples suggests a consistent pattern:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** The algorithm first identifies all pixels with values other than 0.

2. **Preserve Relative Positions:** The relative positions of these non-zero pixels are maintained during the transformation.

3. **Consolidate to Bottom-Right:**  The non-zero pixels are moved towards the bottom-right quadrant of the grid.  While examples 1 and 2 showed a strict bottom-right corner collection, example 3 shows a more relaxed consolidation within the bottom-right area.  The exact positioning within this area might depend on available space and maintaining relative distances.

4. **Fill with Zeros:** The remaining cells in the grid are filled with zeros.

The core logic appears to be a consolidation towards the bottom-right, preserving relative positions of the non-zero elements. The strictness of the bottom-right corner placement might be a result of available space or an inherent characteristic of the algorithm (i.e., less space to move them in the examples makes it appear to be a strict bottom-right corner rule, while more space in examples 3 changes the nature of the consolidation).
