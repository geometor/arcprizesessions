The current algorithm for transforming the grid is fundamentally flawed, as evidenced by the repeated failures to generate the correct output.  The core issue is in accurately maintaining the relative positions of non-zero pixels when moving them to the bottom-right.  The previous attempts to calculate new coordinates directly based on relative positions within the original grid have proven insufficient.  The varied and often non-contiguous arrangements of non-zero pixels present a challenge that requires a more sophisticated approach.

The simple coordinate transformations used previously fail to address the complexities of maintaining both relative positions and order.  More advanced methods such as graph-based approaches, which represent non-zero pixels as nodes and distances as edges, or advanced coordinate mapping techniques (like affine transformations) might be necessary.  These approaches could better handle the varied spatial relationships between non-zero pixels.

Given the current limitations of the algorithm and the lack of a reliable solution, I'm unable to proceed with further transformations of the working grid.  Additional insights or a revised algorithmic approach are crucial to solving this puzzle.  I recommend revisiting the example analysis and potentially exploring more complex algorithmic solutions to accurately preserve relative positions and order during the bottom-right consolidation.  I believe a more robust method of determining relative positions, perhaps using graph techniques or more advanced coordinate mapping, needs to be investigated to achieve a successful transformation.
