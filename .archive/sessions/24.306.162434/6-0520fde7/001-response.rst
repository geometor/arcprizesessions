Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)  white
    *   1: (5) blue
    *   5: (3) gray
*   objects: A central vertical gray column of 3 pixels.  Blue pixels are clustered around the edges.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (8) white
    *   2: (1) red
*   objects: A single red pixel in the center.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: The output is significantly smaller and almost entirely white, with a single red pixel. The input has more blue pixels,  a gray column, and a larger overall size.
*   colors_changed:  The input contains blue and gray; the output only contains red and white.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The size reduction and the color change is dramatic. There doesn't appear to be a direct mapping of positions or colors between input and output.  It's possible that the presence of the gray column in the input triggers the appearance of the red pixel in the output. More examples are needed to confirm any hypotheses about the transformation rule.  The relationship between the size and color changes remains unclear.
