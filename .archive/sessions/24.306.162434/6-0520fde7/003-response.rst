**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11) white
    *   1: (5) blue
    *   5: (3) gray
*   objects: A central vertical gray column of 3 pixels. Blue pixels are present, but not as clustered as in previous examples.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (7) white
    *   2: (2) red
*   objects: Two red pixels in the corners at the bottom left and top right.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: The output is significantly smaller. The arrangement and number of red pixels are different from previous examples.
*   colors_changed: Similar to previous examples.

**Transformation:**

Example 3 further refines our understanding of the transformation. The hypothesis that the number of blue pixels directly correlates to the number of red pixels is incorrect.  The positions of the red pixels also vary.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The input grid is reduced in size. The output grid is 1/3 of the input's dimensions.
2.  **Central Gray Column Detection:** The central vertical gray column is a key feature.
3.  **Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels are placed in the output grid based on the configuration of blue pixels around the central gray column.  The exact pattern is unclear, but it suggests that the presence of blue pixels and the spacing influence the placement of red pixels in the corners of the output.  The number of red pixels does not seem to be strictly tied to the number of blue pixels.

**Further Refinement Needed:**  More examples with variations in blue pixel arrangement and quantities are necessary to precisely define the rules for red pixel placement in the output.  The size reduction ratio should be investigated to determine if there's a consistency to it.
