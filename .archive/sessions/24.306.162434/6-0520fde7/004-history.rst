**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11)  white
    *   1: (5) blue
    *   5: (3) gray
*   objects: A central vertical gray column of 3 pixels.  Blue pixels are clustered around the edges.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (8) white
    *   2: (1) red
*   objects: A single red pixel in the center.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: The output is significantly smaller and almost entirely white, with a single red pixel. The input has more blue pixels,  a gray column, and a larger overall size.
*   colors_changed:  The input contains blue and gray; the output only contains red and white.

**Transformation:**

The transformation is not immediately obvious.  The size reduction and the color change is dramatic. There doesn't appear to be a direct mapping of positions or colors between input and output.  It's possible that the presence of the gray column in the input triggers the appearance of the red pixel in the output. More examples are needed to confirm any hypotheses about the transformation rule.  The relationship between the size and color changes remains unclear.

**example_2**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[1 1 0 5 0 1 0]
     [0 0 1 5 1 1 1]
     [1 1 0 5 0 1 0]]

**output**


.. code-block::

    [[0 2 0]
     [0 0 2]
     [0 2 0]]

**observations**

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11) white
    *   1: (6) blue
    *   5: (3) gray
*   objects: A central vertical gray column of 3 pixels. More blue pixels than in example 1, clustered around the edges.


**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (6) white
    *   2: (3) red
*   objects: Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed:  Similar size reduction as Example 1.  The output has more red pixels than example 1.
*   colors_changed: Similar to example 1: Input has blue and gray; output only has red and white.


**Transformation:**

Comparing Example 1 and Example 2 reveals a potential pattern:

*   The presence of a central vertical gray column in the input seems to be a key feature.
*   The output's size is reduced significantly.
*   The number of red pixels in the output might be related to the number of blue pixels in the input (or the number of clustered blue pixels).  In example 1, we had 5 blue pixels and 1 red pixel.  In example 2, there are 6 blue pixels and 3 red pixels.  This needs further verification.

**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The input grid's width is reduced to create a smaller output grid.  The height is also reduced similarly (to 1/3 or 1/2 or similar proportion).
2.  **Gray Column Detection:** The presence and position of a central vertical gray column in the input is detected.
3.  **Red Pixel Generation:** The central vertical gray column triggers the generation of red pixels in the output.  The number of red pixels may depend on the quantity of blue pixels in the input.  Their arrangement in the output may also be determined by the input's characteristics.


To validate or refine this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples with variations in the input's number of blue pixels, locations of blue pixels, the number of gray columns and locations of these columns.

**example_3**

**input**


.. code-block::

    [[0 0 1 5 0 0 0]
     [1 1 0 5 1 0 1]
     [0 1 1 5 1 0 1]]

     [2 0 0]
     [0 0 2]]

**Example 3**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11) white
    *   1: (5) blue
    *   5: (3) gray
*   objects: A central vertical gray column of 3 pixels. Blue pixels are present, but not as clustered as in previous examples.

**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (7) white
    *   2: (2) red
*   objects: Two red pixels in the corners at the bottom left and top right.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: The output is significantly smaller. The arrangement and number of red pixels are different from previous examples.
*   colors_changed: Similar to previous examples.

**Transformation:**

Example 3 further refines our understanding of the transformation. The hypothesis that the number of blue pixels directly correlates to the number of red pixels is incorrect.  The positions of the red pixels also vary.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The input grid is reduced in size. The output grid is 1/3 of the input's dimensions.
2.  **Central Gray Column Detection:** The central vertical gray column is a key feature.
3.  **Red Pixel Placement:** Red pixels are placed in the output grid based on the configuration of blue pixels around the central gray column.  The exact pattern is unclear, but it suggests that the presence of blue pixels and the spacing influence the placement of red pixels in the corners of the output.  The number of red pixels does not seem to be strictly tied to the number of blue pixels.

**Further Refinement Needed:**  More examples with variations in blue pixel arrangement and quantities are necessary to precisely define the rules for red pixel placement in the output.  The size reduction ratio should be investigated to determine if there's a consistency to it.
