**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (11) white
    *   1: (6) blue
    *   5: (3) gray
*   objects: A central vertical gray column of 3 pixels. More blue pixels than in example 1, clustered around the edges.


**Output:**

*   width: 3
*   height: 3
*   colors:
    *   0: (6) white
    *   2: (3) red
*   objects: Three red pixels arranged in a cross pattern.


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed:  Similar size reduction as Example 1.  The output has more red pixels than example 1.
*   colors_changed: Similar to example 1: Input has blue and gray; output only has red and white.


**Transformation:**

Comparing Example 1 and Example 2 reveals a potential pattern:

*   The presence of a central vertical gray column in the input seems to be a key feature.
*   The output's size is reduced significantly.
*   The number of red pixels in the output might be related to the number of blue pixels in the input (or the number of clustered blue pixels).  In example 1, we had 5 blue pixels and 1 red pixel.  In example 2, there are 6 blue pixels and 3 red pixels.  This needs further verification.

**Revised Transformation Hypothesis:**

The transformation involves:

1.  **Size Reduction:** The input grid's width is reduced to create a smaller output grid.  The height is also reduced similarly (to 1/3 or 1/2 or similar proportion).
2.  **Gray Column Detection:** The presence and position of a central vertical gray column in the input is detected.
3.  **Red Pixel Generation:** The central vertical gray column triggers the generation of red pixels in the output.  The number of red pixels may depend on the quantity of blue pixels in the input.  Their arrangement in the output may also be determined by the input's characteristics.


To validate or refine this hypothesis, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples with variations in the input's number of blue pixels, locations of blue pixels, the number of gray columns and locations of these columns.
