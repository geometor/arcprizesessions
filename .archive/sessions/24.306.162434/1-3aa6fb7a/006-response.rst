Okay, I've initialized the working output grid from the input grid.  Now, let's review the transformation hypothesis and see if we can identify which azure pixels should be changed to blue.

The current hypothesis suggests a preference for changing azure pixels that are adjacent to other azure pixels, with a possible bias towards central vertical locations. However, the lack of a precise rule makes it difficult to proceed without additional examples.

Let's revisit the analysis and incorporate what we have learned from the clusters analysis:

code_execution:
```python
import numpy as np

test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                     [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                     [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                     [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

def find_clusters(grid, value):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
    clusters = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i, j] == value and not visited[i, j]:
                cluster = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                while stack:
                    row, col = stack.pop()
                    if 0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols and grid[row, col] == value and not visited[row, col]:
                        visited[row, col] = True
                        cluster.append((row, col))
                        stack.extend([(row + 1, col), (row - 1, col), (row, col + 1), (row, col - 1)])
                clusters.append(cluster)
    return clusters

clusters = find_clusters(test_input, 8)

#Let's try a simple heuristic: change the first pixel in each cluster
working_output = np.copy(test_input)
for cluster in clusters:
    working_output[cluster[0][0], cluster[0][1]] = 1

print("Working Output:\n", working_output)

```
code_execution_result: 1
```
Working Output:
 [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]
```

This heuristic, changing the first pixel in each cluster to blue, is a tentative solution.  However, without more data to confirm a pattern or to train a more sophisticated model, this is the best approach I can currently take.  Let me know if you want to explore other heuristics, or if you would like to provide more examples.

function_call:
set_range(working_output, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0)

result:
set_range(working_output, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0)
**working output grid**
updated with your changes

[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
 [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
 [1 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



<instructions>
- take a moment to review that the changes in the working output grid are in keeping with the rule
- use code_execution to investigate properties
