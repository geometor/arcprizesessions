Based on the two examples, the transformation involves changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection isn't random; it targets azure pixels that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one other azure (8) pixel. The examples suggest a preference for changing pixels that are located centrally in the vertical axis,  but this might not be a strict requirement.  The number of pixels changed seems to correlate roughly with the number of clusters and overall count of azure pixels.

To investigate further, let's use code to explore patterns:

    example_1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                              [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])
    
    example_2_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                               [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],

                               [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                               [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])
    
    
    def count_adjacent(grid, value):
        count = 0
        rows, cols = grid.shape
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i, j] == value:
                    if i > 0 and grid[i - 1, j] == value:
                        count += 1
                    if i < rows - 1 and grid[i + 1, j] == value:
                        count += 1
                    if j > 0 and grid[i, j - 1] == value:
                        count += 1
                    if j < cols - 1 and grid[i, j + 1] == value:
                        count += 1
        return count
    
    print(f"Example 1: Adjacent azure (8) pixels: {count_adjacent(example_1_input, 8)}")
    print(f"Example 2: Adjacent azure (8) pixels: {count_adjacent(example_2_input, 8)}")

code_execution_result: 1

```
Example 1: Adjacent azure (8) pixels: 8
Example 2: Adjacent azure (8) pixels: 12

```

The code counts adjacent azure pixels.  This doesn't fully explain the transformation, as the number of changes isn't directly proportional to the number of adjacent pixels.  The location of the changes seems to play a role, particularly a preference for the vertical center axis. More examples are needed to confirm or refine the hypothesis.  Further analysis might involve examining cluster properties (size, shape, connectedness), and their relationship to the location and number of changed pixels.  A more sophisticated analysis may even use image processing techniques to identify and analyze the clusters more efficiently.
