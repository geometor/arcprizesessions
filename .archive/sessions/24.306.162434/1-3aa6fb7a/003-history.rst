**observations**

Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (6)
*   objects: A single cluster of azure (8) pixels forms an irregular shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (39)
    *   8: (6)
    *   1: (2)
*   objects: The azure cluster remains; two blue (1) pixels appear, one adjacent to azure (8) pixels in the top middle and bottom middle.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure (8) pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels. Specifically,  some, but not all, of the azure pixels that are diagonally adjacent to other azure pixels are changed.  The pattern isn't fully clear from this one example, we need more to establish a clear rule.  Is this a function of cluster size or shape, or a random selection? The location of the transformation is in the center vertical axis.


To better understand the transformation rule, more examples are needed.  Specifically, examples that vary the size and shape of the azure (8) cluster, or examples without azure (8) clusters, or examples with multiple clusters would help establish the rules.

**observations**

**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects: Multiple clusters of azure (8) pixels.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects: The azure clusters remain; three blue (1) pixels appear, each adjacent to azure (8) pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.

**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1). The change appears to affect isolated azure pixels that are vertically or horizontally adjacent to another azure pixel.  Again, more examples are needed to confirm the rule. Is there a preference for top/bottom or left/right transformations?


**Revised Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, a plausible transformation rule is:  For each cluster of connected azure (8) pixels, select one or more pixels that are adjacent to another azure (8) pixel and change its color to blue (1). The selection of which azure (8) pixel to change appears somewhat arbitrary within the cluster; there isn't a strict algorithm visible yet. The examples suggest a preference for the center vertical axis, however this may not be universal.  Further examples with different cluster sizes, shapes, and locations would greatly aid in refining this hypothesis and identifying if additional constraints exist.
