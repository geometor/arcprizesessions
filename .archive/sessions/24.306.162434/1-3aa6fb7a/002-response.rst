**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (8)
*   objects: Multiple clusters of azure (8) pixels.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (37)
    *   8: (8)
    *   1: (3)
*   objects: The azure clusters remain; three blue (1) pixels appear, each adjacent to azure (8) pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure (8) pixels changed to blue (1) pixels.

**Transformation:**

Similar to Example 1, azure (8) pixels are changed to blue (1). The change appears to affect isolated azure pixels that are vertically or horizontally adjacent to another azure pixel.  Again, more examples are needed to confirm the rule. Is there a preference for top/bottom or left/right transformations?


**Revised Hypothesis:**

Based on both examples, a plausible transformation rule is:  For each cluster of connected azure (8) pixels, select one or more pixels that are adjacent to another azure (8) pixel and change its color to blue (1). The selection of which azure (8) pixel to change appears somewhat arbitrary within the cluster; there isn't a strict algorithm visible yet. The examples suggest a preference for the center vertical axis, however this may not be universal.  Further examples with different cluster sizes, shapes, and locations would greatly aid in refining this hypothesis and identifying if additional constraints exist.
