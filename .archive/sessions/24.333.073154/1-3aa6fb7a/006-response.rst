The ``transform_grid`` function, as implemented in the previous code execution, correctly applies the rule:  change a light blue (8) pixel to blue (1) only if it's not horizontally or vertically adjacent to another light blue (8) pixel.  The test input grid contains no such isolated light blue (8) pixels; therefore, the output grid remains unchanged. This is consistent with the transformation rule.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       output_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8:
                   #Check for adjacent 8's using boolean indexing
                   neighbors = grid[max(0, r - 1):min(rows, r + 2), max(0, c - 1):min(cols, c + 2)]
                   if np.sum(neighbors == 8) == 1: #Only the current cell is 8
                       output_grid[r, c] = 1
       return output_grid

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   test_output = transform_grid(test_input)
   print("Transformed Grid:\n", test_output)

   #Verification
   print("\nVerification:")
   for r in range(test_input.shape[0]):
       for c in range(test_input.shape[1]):
           if test_input[r,c] == 8 and test_output[r,c] == 1:
               print(f"Pixel at ({r},{c}) changed. Check if this is correct.")
           elif test_input[r,c] == 8 and test_output[r,c] == 8:
               is_adjacent = False
               for dr in [-1,0,1]:
                   for dc in [-1,0,1]:
                       if (dr == 0 and dc == 0): continue
                       nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                       if (0 <= nr < test_input.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < test_input.shape[1] and test_input[nr,nc] == 8):
                           is_adjacent = True
                           break
                   if is_adjacent: break
               if is_adjacent == False:
                   print(f"Pixel at ({r},{c}) not changed, but should have been changed.")


   ```code_execution_result:

Transformed Grid:
 [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
 [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
 [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

Verification:
```

The verification section of the code confirms that no pixel was incorrectly changed, and no pixel that should have been changed was left unchanged.  Therefore, the ``transform_grid`` function correctly implements the transformation rule for this test case.  The output grid is identical to the input grid.  No pixels were changed because none satisfied the condition of being an isolated light blue (8) pixel.
