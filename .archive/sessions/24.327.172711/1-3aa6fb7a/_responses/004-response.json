The consistent transformation rule is:  Azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels, horizontally or vertically, change to blue (1).\n\n**Ruminate Phase:**\n\nWe've established a robust natural language program for the transformation:\n\n\"For each pixel in the input grid, if the pixel's value is 8 (azure) and it has at least one adjacent pixel (horizontally or vertically) with a value of 0 (white), then change the value of that pixel to 1 (blue). Otherwise, leave the pixel's value unchanged.\"\n\nThe `transform_grid` function in the previous code execution perfectly implements this natural language program.\n\n**Pre-Test Phase:**  (This phase is skipped as we are directly proceeding to the test.)\n\n\n**Test Phase:**\n\n**Input Grid Analysis:**\n\nThe test input grid presents a scattered distribution of azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels.  This is similar to example 2 in terms of the object type and arrangement. Some azure pixels are clustered; others are isolated.  The size and shape of the azure clusters are irregular.\n\n\n"
