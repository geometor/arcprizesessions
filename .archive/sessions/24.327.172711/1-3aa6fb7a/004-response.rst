004 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's a breakdown of the test input, following the provided framework:

**Review Examples Phase:**

We've already analyzed examples 1 and 2.  The consistent transformation rule is:  Azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels, horizontally or vertically, change to blue (1).

**Ruminate Phase:**

We've established a robust natural language program for the transformation:

"For each pixel in the input grid, if the pixel's value is 8 (azure) and it has at least one adjacent pixel (horizontally or vertically) with a value of 0 (white), then change the value of that pixel to 1 (blue). Otherwise, leave the pixel's value unchanged."

The ``transform_grid`` function in the previous code execution perfectly implements this natural language program.

**Pre-Test Phase:**  (This phase is skipped as we are directly proceeding to the test.)

**Test Phase:**

**Input Grid Analysis:**

The test input grid presents a scattered distribution of azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels.  This is similar to example 2 in terms of the object type and arrangement. Some azure pixels are clustered; others are isolated.  The size and shape of the azure clusters are irregular.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   def transform_grid(grid):
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8:
                   for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                       nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                       if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 0:
                           new_grid[r, c] = 1
                           break
       return new_grid

   test_output = transform_grid(test_input)
   print(f"Test Output:\n{test_output}")

   Test Output:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]



**Prediction:**

Based on the consistent transformation rule observed in the examples and validated by the ``transform_grid`` function, the predicted output grid is shown in the ``tool_outputs`` section above.  The code applies the transformation rule to each pixel of the test input grid, changing azure pixels adjacent to white pixels to blue.
