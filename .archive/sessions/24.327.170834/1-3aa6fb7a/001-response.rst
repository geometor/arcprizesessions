001 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are located at the bottom and to the right of the cluster seem to have changed to blue.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   differences = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences at indices: {differences}")
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {len(differences[0])}")
   print(f"Colors changed from {input_grid[differences]} to {output_grid[differences]}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: bottom-right of azure cluster, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels at the bottom-right edge of the azure cluster are replaced with blue pixels.

Based on the analysis, the transformation appears to selectively change the bottom-rightmost azure pixels to blue.  It's not a simple geometric or arithmetic operation but rather a rule based on position within a cluster.  More examples are needed to confirm this rule.
