001 â€¢ Response
==============


The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels are replaced with blue (1) pixels.  Specifically, the azure pixels that are adjacent to a white (0) pixel on their top or left side are changed to blue.

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1), color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure
       - size: 2, position: (1,2), color: blue
       - size: 2, position: (4,4), color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Some azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.  The specific rule is not clear yet.

Based on the code execution and visual inspection, the transformation appears to involve changing some azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The rule seems to be that azure pixels which have a white (0) pixel to their top or left are changed to blue.  More examples are needed to confirm this and to determine what happens when an azure pixel has white neighbors on both its top and left.
