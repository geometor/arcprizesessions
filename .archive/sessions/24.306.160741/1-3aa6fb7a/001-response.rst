**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's is present, starting at (1,1) and extending to (4,5).


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - The cluster of 8's remains.
    - Two new 1's are added, at positions (1,2) and (4,4).


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two cells containing 8 have been replaced with 1s.


**transformation:**
  - It seems that specific cells within a cluster of the color 8 are changed to the color 1.  The location of the change appears to be at the top-right (1,2) and bottom-left (4,4) positions within the larger 8 cluster.  Further examples are needed to confirm this pattern.
