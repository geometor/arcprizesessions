**example_2**

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 8
  objects:
    - Multiple clusters of 8's are present.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 8
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - The clusters of 8's remain.
    - Three new 1's have been added at positions (1,5), (2,3), and (5,3).

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three cells containing 8 have been replaced with 1s.

**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, it appears that specific cells within clusters of 8 are changed to 1.  The pattern isn't immediately clear, as the added 1's aren't consistently located at the top-right or bottom-left positions within their clusters as was speculated in Example 1.  Further analysis is required to fully define this transformation.  The added 1's appear to be in the same relative locations within the respective clusters.  More examples are needed to confirm patterns and rules, as the observed pattern is not consistent for the clusters present.
