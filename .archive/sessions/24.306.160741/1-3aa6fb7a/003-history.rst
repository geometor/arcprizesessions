**observations**

**example_1**

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 6
  objects:
    - A single cluster of 8's is present, starting at (1,1) and extending to (4,5).


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 42
    - 8: 6
    - 1: 2
  objects:
    - The cluster of 8's remains.
    - Two new 1's are added, at positions (1,2) and (4,4).


**differences:**
  cells_changed: 2
  colors_changed: Two cells containing 8 have been replaced with 1s.


**transformation:**
  - It seems that specific cells within a cluster of the color 8 are changed to the color 1.  The location of the change appears to be at the top-right (1,2) and bottom-left (4,4) positions within the larger 8 cluster.  Further examples are needed to confirm this pattern.

**observations**

**example_2**

**input:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 43
    - 8: 8
  objects:
    - Multiple clusters of 8's are present.


**output:**
  width: 7
  height: 7
  colors:
    - 0: 40
    - 8: 8
    - 1: 3
  objects:
    - The clusters of 8's remain.
    - Three new 1's have been added at positions (1,5), (2,3), and (5,3).

**differences:**
  cells_changed: 3
  colors_changed: Three cells containing 8 have been replaced with 1s.

**transformation:**
  - Similar to example 1, it appears that specific cells within clusters of 8 are changed to 1.  The pattern isn't immediately clear, as the added 1's aren't consistently located at the top-right or bottom-left positions within their clusters as was speculated in Example 1.  Further analysis is required to fully define this transformation.  The added 1's appear to be in the same relative locations within the respective clusters.  More examples are needed to confirm patterns and rules, as the observed pattern is not consistent for the clusters present.
