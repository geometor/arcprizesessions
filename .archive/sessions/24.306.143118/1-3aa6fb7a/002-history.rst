Here's an analysis of the provided example:

**Example 1**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: A single cluster of 8 (azure) pixels, arranged roughly in an inverted L-shape.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (39)
    *   1: (2)
    *   8: (5)
*   objects: The main cluster remains, but two '8' pixels have been changed to '1' (blue) pixels.  These are located at positions (1,2) and (4,5)


**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 2
*   colors_changed: Two azure pixels have been changed to blue pixels.

**Transformation:**

The transformation appears to involve changing the color of specific azure (`8`) pixels to blue (`1`) pixels. The location of these changes seems somewhat arbitrary based on this single example.  Additional examples are needed to define a clear rule or pattern governing pixel selection. There may be a positional or sequential element that isn't yet obvious.


To proceed, I need more examples to establish a robust pattern for the transformation.  One example is insufficient to reliably determine the underlying rule.
