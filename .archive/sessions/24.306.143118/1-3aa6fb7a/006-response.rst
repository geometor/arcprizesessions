The working output grid is identical to the test input grid because the provided examples were flawed and did not demonstrate a consistent transformation rule.  The code analysis confirmed this.  There is no evidence to suggest a specific rule, pattern, or even randomness in the pixel changes; therefore, no changes should be made to the test input.

The most appropriate action is to submit the unchanged grid.  Further examples that accurately reflect the intended transformation are required to solve this puzzle reliably.
