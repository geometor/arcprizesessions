**Example 2**

**Input:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (41)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects: Multiple clusters of azure pixels.

**Output:**

*   width: 7
*   height: 7
*   colors:
    *   0: (38)
    *   1: (3)
    *   8: (7)
*   objects:  The main clusters remain, but three azure ('8') pixels are changed to blue ('1') pixels.

**Differences:**

*   cells_changed: 3
*   colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

**Transformation:**

The pattern continues from Example 1.  Azure pixels are being selectively changed to blue.  There is still no readily apparent rule dictating *which* azure pixels are changed. The changes are not at the edges of the object or in any easily definable pattern.


**Combined Analysis of Examples 1 and 2:**

Both examples show a transformation where some, but not all, azure pixels are converted to blue pixels. The selection of pixels to change appears non-deterministic based solely on these two examples.  The number of pixels changed seems to loosely correlate with the number of azure pixels in the input.  Further examples are needed to definitively determine the transformation rule.  Potential factors to consider in subsequent examples:

* **Spatial Relationships:** Are the pixels selected based on proximity to other pixels of specific colors?
* **Sequential Selection:**  Is there a left-to-right, top-to-bottom or other sequential order involved in pixel selection?
* **Cluster Size:** Does the size or shape of azure clusters affect which pixels are changed?
* **Count-Based Selection:** Is a fixed number or proportion of azure pixels changed (e.g., always change 20% of the azure pixels)?



To confidently determine the transformation rule, more examples with varying input sizes and cluster arrangements are required.
