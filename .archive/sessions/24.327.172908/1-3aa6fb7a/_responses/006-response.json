Before making changes, let's refine our understanding of the transformation rule based on the previous examples and the new analysis.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation consistently replaces a *subset* of azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels.  The selection criterion focuses on azure pixels located at the *perimeter* of the azure cluster.  The selection is not exhaustive; not all perimeter pixels are changed. The number of pixels changed seems to be somewhat proportional to the overall size of the cluster, but a precise formula remains elusive.\n\n**Code Execution for Refined Analysis:**\n\nLet's create code to identify the perimeter pixels more accurately and explore potential selection patterns.\n\n\n"
