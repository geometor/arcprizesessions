The selection of which azure pixels to change appears to be based on their location within the cluster of azure pixels. Specifically, it seems that azure pixels located at the perimeter or edges of the cluster are targeted for transformation into blue pixels. Not all edge pixels are changed; only a portion of them are altered.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the size and shape of the azure cluster.\n\n\n"
