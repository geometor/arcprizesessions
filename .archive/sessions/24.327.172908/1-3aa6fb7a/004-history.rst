**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some azure (8) pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  The blue (1) pixels appear to replace some of the azure (8) pixels that are located at the bottom or right edge of the azure cluster.

   transformation:
     - Replace some azure pixels with blue pixels.  The specific azure pixels replaced seem to be those located at the bottom or right edge of the azure cluster.

The transformation involves selectively changing some azure pixels to blue pixels. The selection criteria appear to be based on the position of the azure pixels within the cluster: those at the bottom or right edge are changed.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine if there are other influencing factors.

**observations**



The input grid contains a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is very similar, but some azure pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels. The blue pixels seem to be located at the perimeter of the azure cluster.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
   print(f"Difference Grid:\n{diff_grid}")

   azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
   print(f"Indices of azure pixels:\n{azure_indices}")

   changed_indices = np.where(diff_grid != 0)

       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Replace some azure pixels with blue pixels.  The azure pixels that are replaced appear to be on the perimeter of the azure cluster.

The transformation in this example is consistent with the previous one:  some azure pixels at the edge of the cluster are changed to blue.  The pattern seems to be to replace some (but not all) edge pixels of the azure cluster with blue pixels.  Further examples are needed to refine the rule and determine if there's a specific algorithm for selecting which edge pixels to change.



**examples summary**



Based on the two examples, the transformation consistently involves changing a subset of azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels to change appears to be based on their location within the cluster of azure pixels. Specifically, it seems that azure pixels located at the perimeter or edges of the cluster are targeted for transformation into blue pixels. Not all edge pixels are changed; only a portion of them are altered.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the size and shape of the azure cluster.

The code confirms the observation that the changes are localized to the edges of the azure clusters.  However, a precise algorithm for selecting *which* edge pixels to change remains elusive from just two examples.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a consistent rule, or if the selection is somewhat arbitrary (within the constraint of being edge pixels).  For example, does the selection prioritize bottom/right edges? Or is it random sampling of edge pixels?  Further analysis would require more data.
