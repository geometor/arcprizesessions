**observations**



The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels forming an irregular shape. The output grid is almost identical, except that some azure (8) pixels have been replaced by blue (1) pixels.  The blue (1) pixels appear to replace some of the azure (8) pixels that are located at the bottom or right edge of the azure cluster.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff_grid = output_grid - input_grid
   print(f"Difference Grid:\n{diff_grid}")

   azure_indices = np.where(input_grid == 8)
   print(f"Indices of azure pixels:\n{azure_indices}")

   changed_indices = np.where(diff_grid != 0)
   print(f"Indices of changed pixels:\n{changed_indices}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: (1,1), color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 42
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure
       - size: 2, position: (1,2) (4,4), color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Replace some azure pixels with blue pixels.  The specific azure pixels replaced seem to be those located at the bottom or right edge of the azure cluster.

The transformation involves selectively changing some azure pixels to blue pixels. The selection criteria appear to be based on the position of the azure pixels within the cluster: those at the bottom or right edge are changed.  Further examples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine if there are other influencing factors.

INSTRUCTIONS:




* 
  Review Examples Phase

  pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

  you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

  you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
  after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

  use a yaml block for the details

  .. code-block:: yaml

     input:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     output:
       width: X
       height: Y
       colors:
         - N: (count)
       objects:
         - size, position and color - desc

  .. code-block:: yaml

     differences:
       cells_changed: N
       colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

  your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid
  * run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you
    use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code print
    you findings in the output
    remember that you have access to many python libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
  * review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program is for the transformation
