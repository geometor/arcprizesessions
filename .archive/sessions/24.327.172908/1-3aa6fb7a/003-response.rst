003 â€¢ Response
==============


Based on the two examples, the transformation consistently involves changing a subset of azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The selection of which azure pixels to change appears to be based on their location within the cluster of azure pixels. Specifically, it seems that azure pixels located at the perimeter or edges of the cluster are targeted for transformation into blue pixels. Not all edge pixels are changed; only a portion of them are altered.  The number of pixels changed varies depending on the size and shape of the azure cluster.

The code confirms the observation that the changes are localized to the edges of the azure clusters.  However, a precise algorithm for selecting *which* edge pixels to change remains elusive from just two examples.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a consistent rule, or if the selection is somewhat arbitrary (within the constraint of being edge pixels).  For example, does the selection prioritize bottom/right edges? Or is it random sampling of edge pixels?  Further analysis would require more data.
