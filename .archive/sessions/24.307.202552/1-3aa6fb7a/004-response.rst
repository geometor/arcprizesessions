Based on the previous examples, the transformation appears to add blue pixels (value 1) around clusters of azure pixels (value 8). The number of blue pixels added seems to be roughly proportional to the number of azure pixels.  Let's analyze the test input and formulate a hypothesis.



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   azure_count = np.count_nonzero(test_input == 8)
   print(f"Number of azure pixels: {azure_count}")

   #Estimate number of blue pixels to add based on previous examples
   estimated_blue_pixels = int(azure_count / 3)
   print(f"Estimated number of blue pixels to add: {estimated_blue_pixels}")



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   Number of azure pixels: 12
   Estimated number of blue pixels to add: 4



The estimated number of blue pixels to add is 4.  Let's visually inspect the input grid to predict likely locations for these blue pixels.  It seems reasonable to add them adjacent to the existing azure clusters, possibly at the corners or edges to fill in gaps.

**Proposed output (hypothesis):**

Based on the estimated number of blue pixels and observations from the previous examples, I propose the following output.  Note that this is a hypothesis and may need adjustments depending on the actual solution:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_output = np.copy(test_input)
   test_output[0, 5] = 1  #Top
   test_output[1, 0] = 1 #Left side
   test_output[5, 1] = 1 #Bottom
   test_output[4, 3] = 1 #Inside

   print(test_output)



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]



This proposed output adds four blue pixels in locations that appear to fill gaps or are adjacent to existing azure pixels, similar to the patterns observed in previous examples.  The locations were chosen strategically based on visual inspection.  However, without further information or examples, it's difficult to be absolutely certain about the correct solution.  This is a best guess based on the limited data and the observed pattern.  Confirmation or correction may be needed based on subsequent information.
