**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 41
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,4), color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Add two blue pixels at specific locations relative to the azure object.  The locations appear to be at the top right and bottom left corners of the azure object.

The transformation involves adding two blue pixels (value 1) to specific locations within the input grid. These locations are relative to the existing cluster of azure pixels (value 8).  More examples are needed to determine if the position of the added blue pixels is consistent or follows a more complex rule based on the size or shape of the azure cluster.

     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 8
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure

     output:

       colors:
         - 0: 39
         - 8: 8
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Add three blue pixels at specific locations relative to the azure objects.  The added blue pixels appear adjacent to the azure pixels.  The pattern is not immediately clear from this example alone.

The transformation in this example is similar to the first example, but now three blue pixels are added. The positions seem to be adjacent to the existing azure pixels, however without more examples it is impossible to determine whether the placement of these pixels is truly relative to the azure object's position or is determined by some other rule.  It is also not clear if the number of added blue pixels is related to the number of azure pixels.  More examples are needed to solidify these observations.



**examples summary**



Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding blue pixels (value 1) to locations adjacent to or near existing azure pixels (value 8).  The number of blue pixels added seems to vary, and their exact placement relative to the azure pixels isn't entirely consistent across the examples.  However, there is a tendency to add blue pixels at "corners" or edges of the existing azure cluster.

To clarify the transformation rules, additional examples are necessary to determine:


#. 
   **The rule for determining the number of blue pixels to add:** Is it related to the total number of azure pixels, the size of the largest connected azure cluster, or some other factor?

#. 
   **The rule for determining the precise placement of the new blue pixels:** Is it based on proximity to existing azure pixels, or is there a more complex geometric relationship?

#. 
   **The effect of azure pixel cluster shape and size:** Do different shapes or sizes of azure clusters result in different numbers or placements of added blue pixels?

Let's analyze the provided examples using code to highlight some properties of the grids:

.. code-block::

   Example 1:
   Input Azure Count: 6
   Output Blue Count: 2

   Example 2:
   Input Azure Count: 9
   Output Blue Count: 3

   Difference Matrices:
   Example 1:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Example 2:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]



The code analysis reveals a potential correlation: the number of blue pixels added seems to be approximately one-third the number of azure pixels in the input.  This is an approximation and needs more testing.  The difference matrices show the locations of the added blue pixels.  More examples are needed to confirm any pattern in placement beyond the proximity to existing azure pixels.  The placement doesn't appear to be strictly defined, adding more examples will be very useful to solidify our understanding.
