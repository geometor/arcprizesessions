**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 5
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 41
         - 8: 5
         - 1: 2
       objects:
         - size: 5x3, position: (1,1), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (1,2), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (5,4), color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 2
       colors_changed: Two azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Add two blue pixels at specific locations relative to the azure object.  The locations appear to be at the top right and bottom left corners of the azure object.

The transformation involves adding two blue pixels (value 1) to specific locations within the input grid. These locations are relative to the existing cluster of azure pixels (value 8).  More examples are needed to determine if the position of the added blue pixels is consistent or follows a more complex rule based on the size or shape of the azure cluster.

**observations**



.. code-block:: yaml

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 42
         - 8: 8
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure

     output:
       width: 7
       height: 7
       colors:
         - 0: 39
         - 8: 8
         - 1: 3
       objects:
         - size: 8, position: scattered, color: azure
         - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue.
     transformation:
       - Add three blue pixels at specific locations relative to the azure objects.  The added blue pixels appear adjacent to the azure pixels.  The pattern is not immediately clear from this example alone.

The transformation in this example is similar to the first example, but now three blue pixels are added. The positions seem to be adjacent to the existing azure pixels, however without more examples it is impossible to determine whether the placement of these pixels is truly relative to the azure object's position or is determined by some other rule.  It is also not clear if the number of added blue pixels is related to the number of azure pixels.  More examples are needed to solidify these observations.
