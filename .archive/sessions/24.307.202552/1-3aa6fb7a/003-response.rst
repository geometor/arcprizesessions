==============


Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to involve adding blue pixels (value 1) to locations adjacent to or near existing azure pixels (value 8).  The number of blue pixels added seems to vary, and their exact placement relative to the azure pixels isn't entirely consistent across the examples.  However, there is a tendency to add blue pixels at "corners" or edges of the existing azure cluster.

To clarify the transformation rules, additional examples are necessary to determine:


#. 
   **The rule for determining the number of blue pixels to add:** Is it related to the total number of azure pixels, the size of the largest connected azure cluster, or some other factor?

#. 
   **The rule for determining the precise placement of the new blue pixels:** Is it based on proximity to existing azure pixels, or is there a more complex geometric relationship?

#. 
   **The effect of azure pixel cluster shape and size:** Do different shapes or sizes of azure clusters result in different numbers or placements of added blue pixels?

Let's analyze the provided examples using code to highlight some properties of the grids:

.. code-block::

   Example 1:
   Input Azure Count: 6
   Output Blue Count: 2

   Example 2:
   Input Azure Count: 9
   Output Blue Count: 3

   Difference Matrices:
   Example 1:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Example 2:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]



The code analysis reveals a potential correlation: the number of blue pixels added seems to be approximately one-third the number of azure pixels in the input.  This is an approximation and needs more testing.  The difference matrices show the locations of the added blue pixels.  More examples are needed to confirm any pattern in placement beyond the proximity to existing azure pixels.  The placement doesn't appear to be strictly defined, adding more examples will be very useful to solidify our understanding.
