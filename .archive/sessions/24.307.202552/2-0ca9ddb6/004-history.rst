**observations**



Based on the provided input and output grids, here's my analysis:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,6), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,6), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (4,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,5), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange colors around existing red and blue.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add a pattern around the existing colored cells (red and blue).  The pattern consists of a yellow square above and below the red cell and orange squares around the blue cell.

My reasoning is as follows:

The output grid is a modified version of the input grid.  The original red and blue cells remain in their original positions.  However, new cells are added surrounding these points.  The new cells form a larger pattern, with yellow squares appearing above and below the red cell, and orange cells surrounding the blue cell.  This suggests that the transformation is based on the location and color of the existing cells and a rule involving a spatial pattern.  There is no obvious mathematical relationship between the colors.  It appears to be more of a positional rule.

         - size: 2x2, position: (3,7), color: orange
         - size: 2x2, position: (0,7), color: orange


     differences:
       cells_changed: 20
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange colors around existing red and blue cells.  Also added orange above the blue cell.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example 1, the transformation adds a pattern around existing colored cells. Yellow squares are added near red cells, and orange squares are added around the blue cells.  The placement of yellow and orange seems less consistent than in example 1.

**Analysis of both examples:**

Both examples show a similar transformation.  Existing colored cells (red and blue) remain in place. New yellow and orange cells are added around these original cells.  The pattern isn't perfectly consistent in its application between the two examples.  In example 1, the yellow cells form a consistent pattern above and below the red cell.  Example 2 shows more variability in positioning and the inclusion of orange cells is less symmetrical. This inconsistency suggests potential issues in defining a rigid rule.

**Hypotheses:**


#. **Proximity-based rule:**  The addition of yellow and orange cells is based on proximity to the existing red and blue cells.  The exact pattern might be loosely defined or based on available space.
#. **Incomplete rule:** The rule is incompletely defined or there are additional factors not immediately obvious from the examples.
#. **Context-dependent rule:** The specific placement of yellow and orange cells might depend on the overall context and positions of the original colored cells within the grid.

Further examples are needed to refine the rule and assess its consistency.  The variation in application between the two examples makes a perfectly defined rule difficult to formulate at this stage.

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange colors around existing red and blue cells.
     transformation:
       - Similar to examples 1 and 2, yellow squares are added around the red cell and orange squares around the blue cell.  The magenta cell is unchanged.

**Overall Analysis of Examples 1-3:**

The transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange squares around the red and blue cells, respectively.  The pattern is not perfectly rigid;  the exact placement and number of added squares might vary slightly depending on the proximity of other elements or available space. There seems to be no relationship between the color of the existing cells and the color of the added cells (yellow always for red and orange always for blue). The core transformation is an expansion of existing colored cells using specific colors.

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule is a proximity-based addition of new colored cells around existing colored cells:


* Red cells get yellow squares added above and below.
* Blue cells get orange squares added around them.
* Other colors remain unaffected.
* The exact placement might be influenced by spatial constraints, but the core principle is the expansion of existing colored objects.

This hypothesis better encapsulates the observed variations in the placement of the new cells.  Further examples would help verify and potentially refine this hypothesis.
