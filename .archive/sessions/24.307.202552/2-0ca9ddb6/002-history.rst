**observations**



Based on the provided input and output grids, here's my analysis:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (71)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,6), color: blue
     output:
       width: 9
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: (63)
         - 1: (1)
         - 2: (1)
         - 4: (4)
         - 7: (4)
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: red
         - size: 1x1, position: (6,6), color: blue
         - size: 2x2, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (4,1), color: yellow
         - size: 2x2, position: (6,5), color: orange

     differences:
       cells_changed: 12
       colors_changed: Added yellow and orange colors around existing red and blue.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to add a pattern around the existing colored cells (red and blue).  The pattern consists of a yellow square above and below the red cell and orange squares around the blue cell.

My reasoning is as follows:

The output grid is a modified version of the input grid.  The original red and blue cells remain in their original positions.  However, new cells are added surrounding these points.  The new cells form a larger pattern, with yellow squares appearing above and below the red cell, and orange cells surrounding the blue cell.  This suggests that the transformation is based on the location and color of the existing cells and a rule involving a spatial pattern.  There is no obvious mathematical relationship between the colors.  It appears to be more of a positional rule.
