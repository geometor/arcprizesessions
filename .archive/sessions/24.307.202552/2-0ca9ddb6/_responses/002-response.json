Also added orange above the blue cell.\n  transformation:\n    - Similar to example 1, the transformation adds a pattern around existing colored cells. Yellow squares are added near red cells, and orange squares are added around the blue cells.  The placement of yellow and orange seems less consistent than in example 1.\n```\n\n**Analysis of both examples:**\n\nBoth examples show a similar transformation.  Existing colored cells (red and blue) remain in place. New yellow and orange cells are added around these original cells.  The pattern isn't perfectly consistent in its application between the two examples.  In example 1, the yellow cells form a consistent pattern above and below the red cell.  Example 2 shows more variability in positioning and the inclusion of orange cells is less symmetrical. This inconsistency suggests potential issues in defining a rigid rule.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n\n1. **Proximity-based rule:**  The addition of yellow and orange cells is based on proximity to the existing red and blue cells.  The exact pattern might be loosely defined or based on available space.\n2. **Incomplete rule:** The rule is incompletely defined or there are additional factors not immediately obvious from the examples.\n3. **Context-dependent rule:** The specific placement of yellow and orange cells might depend on the overall context and positions of the original colored cells within the grid.\n\nFurther examples are needed to refine the rule and assess its consistency.  The variation in application between the two examples makes a perfectly defined rule difficult to formulate at this stage.\n"
