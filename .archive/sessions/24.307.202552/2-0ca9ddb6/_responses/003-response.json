The magenta cell is unchanged.\n```\n\n**Overall Analysis of Examples 1-3:**\n\nThe transformation consistently involves adding yellow and orange squares around the red and blue cells, respectively.  The pattern is not perfectly rigid;  the exact placement and number of added squares might vary slightly depending on the proximity of other elements or available space. There seems to be no relationship between the color of the existing cells and the color of the added cells (yellow always for red and orange always for blue). The core transformation is an expansion of existing colored cells using specific colors.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a proximity-based addition of new colored cells around existing colored cells:\n\n- Red cells get yellow squares added above and below.\n- Blue cells get orange squares added around them.\n- Other colors remain unaffected.\n- The exact placement might be influenced by spatial constraints, but the core principle is the expansion of existing colored objects.\n\n\nThis hypothesis better encapsulates the observed variations in the placement of the new cells.  Further examples would help verify and potentially refine this hypothesis.\n"
