The pattern consists of a yellow square above and below the red cell and orange squares around the blue cell.\n```\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\nThe output grid is a modified version of the input grid.  The original red and blue cells remain in their original positions.  However, new cells are added surrounding these points.  The new cells form a larger pattern, with yellow squares appearing above and below the red cell, and orange cells surrounding the blue cell.  This suggests that the transformation is based on the location and color of the existing cells and a rule involving a spatial pattern.  There is no obvious mathematical relationship between the colors.  It appears to be more of a positional rule.\n"
