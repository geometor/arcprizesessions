.. code-block:: yaml

   example_3:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 13
         - 1: 6
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue and white,  The central column is white, with blue pixels surrounding it.  There is a gray pixel slightly offset.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 7
         - 2: 2
       objects:
         - size: 3x3, position: 0,0, color: Mostly white, with two red pixels in the corners (bottom left and top right).
     differences:
       cells_changed: 22
       colors_changed: Input has blue and white and gray; Output has red and white.  The output is significantly smaller and simpler than the input.
     transformation:
       - Similar dimensionality reduction as in example 1 and 2.
       - The output seems to represent a pattern or structure related to the input's central region.  The red pixels in the output seem to correspond to the "absence" of blue in the central area of the input.
       - The dominant color is largely irrelevant, while the central layout of the input influences the output.

**Further Refined Thoughts:**

The pattern is becoming clearer.  The transformation appears to involve:


#. **Downsampling:** The input is downsampled to a 3x3 grid.
#. **Central Focus:** The transformation focuses on the central 3x3 region of the input.
#. **Inverse Blue Mapping:**  The output grid is predominantly white. Red pixels (color 2) appear in the output locations that correspond to *white* pixels in the central 3x3 region of the input.  Conversely, where there is a blue pixel in the central region of the input, there's a white pixel in the same location in the output.

**Prediction for a new input:**

Let's hypothesize the transformation for a new input. If the central 3x3 region of the input contains a pattern of blue and white pixels, the output will contain red pixels where the input had white pixels in the central region, and white pixels where the input had blue pixels in the central region.  The overall size will be reduced to 3x3.

To test this, we need more examples, particularly ones with more complex central patterns in the input.  Examples with different color dominances would also help to verify if color dominance is truly irrelevant.
