The column is central in the x direction and mostly in the y direction.  There is a gray pixel slightly offset.\n  output:\n    width: 3\n    height: 3\n    colors:\n      - 0: 8\n      - 2: 1\n    objects:\n      - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red, a single red pixel in the center.\n  differences:\n    cells_changed: 23\n    colors_changed: Input has blue and white and gray; Output has red and white.  The output is significantly smaller and simpler.\n  transformation:\n    - The transformation appears to involve reducing the size and complexity of the input. \n    - The dominant color (blue in the input) seems irrelevant to the output.\n    - The key transformation is identifying the center of the input and placing a red pixel in the center of the smaller output.\n```\n\n**Initial Thoughts:**\n\nThe transformation isn't immediately obvious.  It's likely not a simple geometric transformation (rotation, mirroring, etc.).  The process might involve:\n\n1. **Dimensionality Reduction:** The output grid is smaller than the input.\n2. **Feature Extraction:**  The output might represent a central feature of the input.  In this case, the center of the input seems to be relevant.\n3. **Color Change:** The central feature changes color (from blue to red).  The overall color distribution in the input seems largely ignored.\n\nFurther examples are needed to confirm these hypotheses.\n"
