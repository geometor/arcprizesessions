001 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's an analysis of the provided example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 7
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 16
         - 1: 5
         - 5: 1
       objects:
         - size: 3x7, position: 0,0, color: blue and white, a vertical column of blue pixels surrounded by white pixels.  The column is central in the x direction and mostly in the y direction.  There is a gray pixel slightly offset.
     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 0: 8
         - 2: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: 1,1, color: red, a single red pixel in the center.
     differences:
       cells_changed: 23
       colors_changed: Input has blue and white and gray; Output has red and white.  The output is significantly smaller and simpler.
     transformation:
       - The transformation appears to involve reducing the size and complexity of the input. 
       - The dominant color (blue in the input) seems irrelevant to the output.
       - The key transformation is identifying the center of the input and placing a red pixel in the center of the smaller output.

**Initial Thoughts:**

The transformation isn't immediately obvious.  It's likely not a simple geometric transformation (rotation, mirroring, etc.).  The process might involve:


#. **Dimensionality Reduction:** The output grid is smaller than the input.
#. **Feature Extraction:**  The output might represent a central feature of the input.  In this case, the center of the input seems to be relevant.
#. **Color Change:** The central feature changes color (from blue to red).  The overall color distribution in the input seems largely ignored.

Further examples are needed to confirm these hypotheses.
