   example_1:
     input:
       width: 4
       height: 4
       colors:
         - 0: 10
         - 1: 1
         - 4: 2
         - 6: 1
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: maroon
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
     output:
       width: 4
       height: 4
       colors:
         - 0: 12
         - 1: 1
         - 4: 2
         - 6: 1
         - 9: 1
       objects:
         - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: magenta
         - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow

     differences:
       cells_changed: 8
       colors_changed:  Non-zero values are moved to the bottom row.  The rest are set to 0.
     transformation:
       - The non-zero values from the input grid are moved to the bottom row of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.
       - The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with zeros.

My reasoning is based on observing the movement of the colored blocks from the input to the output grid.  The transformation appears to be a consolidation of non-zero values into the last row, maintaining their order.  The top three rows are entirely filled with zeros.
