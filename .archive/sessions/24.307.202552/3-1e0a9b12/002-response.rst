         - size: 1x1, position: (1,3), color: azure
         - size: 1x1, position: (0,5), color: maroon

     output:
       width: 6
       height: 6
       colors:
         - 0: 34
         - 4: 3

     differences:
       cells_changed: 3
       colors_changed: The non-zero values in the last row of the input are moved to the last row of the output, maintaining their relative order.  Additional values are added to the last row.
     transformation:
       - Non-zero values from the input grid are moved to the bottom row of the output grid.  The relative positions of these values are preserved.
       - Additional non-zero values from the input grid are added to the bottom row, maintaining their relative order.

The transformation in both examples involves moving non-zero values to the bottom row of the output grid while preserving their relative positions.  In example 2, additional values are appended to the bottom row.  The remaining cells are filled with zeros.  The transformation appears to be a consolidation and appending of non-zero values to the bottom row, maintaining their horizontal order.
