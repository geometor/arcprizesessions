**observations**



Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 81
         - 5: 19
       objects:
         - size: 19, position: centered, color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 72
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 19
       objects:
         - size: 19, position: centered, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 19
       colors_changed: Gray pixels changed to a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the original shape.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is re-colored.  Gray is replaced with a similar shape composed of azure and red.
       - The replacement pattern appears to involve a mirroring of the original object about a central vertical axis.
       - The red pixels replace the most inner cells of the gray object. The outer cells are azure.

**Initial Thoughts and Further Investigation:**

The transformation seems to involve a recoding of the central gray object. The shape is preserved, but the color changes.  A simple color mapping isn't sufficient; the new colors follow a specific internal pattern.  To solidify the rules, it would be beneficial to have more examples with variations in the size and shape of the gray object.  Are there rules on how the red and azure are distributed within the new shape?  Does the transformation always maintain symmetry around a vertical axis?  These questions will be answered with more examples.

   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: left-center, color: gray
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 56
         - 2: 8
         - 8: 8
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: left-center, color: azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced with azure and red pixels, maintaining the original shape.  The replacement pattern mirrors the shape of the original grey object.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, the gray object is recolored.
       - Azure and red colors replace gray maintaining the original shape.
       - The red pixels fill the innermost part of the shape, with azure as the outer layer.  The pattern reflects across a vertical axis

**Revised Thoughts and Further Investigation:**

The pattern is solidifying.  The transformation consistently involves:


#. **Shape Preservation:** The shape of the gray object remains unchanged.
#. **Color Replacement:** Gray is replaced with a combination of azure and red.
#. **Internal Pattern:** Red forms an inner shape within the azure, mirroring the grey's basic form about a vertical axis.  The outer shell is always azure.

To further test and refine the hypothesis, more examples are needed, particularly those with:


* **Varying shapes:**  Different gray object forms.
* **Size variations:** Larger and smaller gray objects.
* **Position changes:** Gray object positioned at different locations.
* **Discontinuous shapes:**  Gray objects with gaps or missing parts.

The provided examples hint at a relatively consistent and predictable transformation, making a robust hypothesis possible with a few more test cases.  The next step will be to formulate code to replicate the transformation.

         - 8: 6
       objects:
         - size: 11, position: center-left, color: azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 11
       colors_changed: Gray pixels replaced with azure and red pixels, maintaining the original shape.
     transformation:
       - The gray object is recolored.
       - Red pixels form the inner part of the object.
       - Azure pixels form the outer part of the object.
       - The pattern reflects across a vertical axis, similar to previous examples.

**Summary of Observations across all three examples:**

The transformation consistently involves a gray object that is recolored using azure and red pixels. The shape of the original gray object is perfectly preserved. The red pixels always constitute the inner part of the transformed object, while the azure pixels form the outer layer.  The arrangement displays a vertical reflection symmetry.

The transformation is deterministic and rule-based. The rules appear to be:


#. **Identify Gray Object:** Locate all connected gray pixels.
#. **Preserve Shape:** Maintain the exact shape and size of the gray object.
#. **Inner/Outer Coloring:**  Replace the inner-most gray pixels with red, and the remaining gray pixels with azure. The 'innermost' is determined by a vertical reflection about a central vertical axis. Pixels are considered 'inner' if their reflection is also part of the gray object.
#. **Symmetry:**  The final azure and red pattern displays reflection symmetry across a vertical axis.

This pattern holds across varying object sizes, shapes, and positions within the grid.  We can now proceed to the test phase with confidence in this hypothesis.
