001 â€¢ Response
==============


Here's an analysis of the provided example, aiming to identify the transformation rules:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example_1:
     input:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 81
         - 5: 19
       objects:
         - size: 19, position: centered, color: gray
     output:
       width: 11
       height: 9
       colors:
         - 0: 72
         - 2: 7
         - 8: 19
       objects:
         - size: 19, position: centered, color: azure
     differences:
       cells_changed: 19
       colors_changed: Gray pixels changed to a combination of azure and red pixels, maintaining the original shape.
     transformation:
       - The central gray object is re-colored.  Gray is replaced with a similar shape composed of azure and red.
       - The replacement pattern appears to involve a mirroring of the original object about a central vertical axis.
       - The red pixels replace the most inner cells of the gray object. The outer cells are azure.

**Initial Thoughts and Further Investigation:**

The transformation seems to involve a recoding of the central gray object. The shape is preserved, but the color changes.  A simple color mapping isn't sufficient; the new colors follow a specific internal pattern.  To solidify the rules, it would be beneficial to have more examples with variations in the size and shape of the gray object.  Are there rules on how the red and azure are distributed within the new shape?  Does the transformation always maintain symmetry around a vertical axis?  These questions will be answered with more examples.
