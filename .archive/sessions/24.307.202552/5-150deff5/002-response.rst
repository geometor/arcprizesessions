   example_2:
     input:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 64
         - 5: 16
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: left-center, color: gray
     output:
       width: 10
       height: 8
       colors:
         - 0: 56
         - 2: 8
         - 8: 8
       objects:
         - size: 16, position: left-center, color: azure and red
     differences:
       cells_changed: 16
       colors_changed: Gray pixels are replaced with azure and red pixels, maintaining the original shape.  The replacement pattern mirrors the shape of the original grey object.
     transformation:
       - Similar to example_1, the gray object is recolored.
       - Azure and red colors replace gray maintaining the original shape.
       - The red pixels fill the innermost part of the shape, with azure as the outer layer.  The pattern reflects across a vertical axis

**Revised Thoughts and Further Investigation:**

The pattern is solidifying.  The transformation consistently involves:


#. **Shape Preservation:** The shape of the gray object remains unchanged.
#. **Color Replacement:** Gray is replaced with a combination of azure and red.
#. **Internal Pattern:** Red forms an inner shape within the azure, mirroring the grey's basic form about a vertical axis.  The outer shell is always azure.

To further test and refine the hypothesis, more examples are needed, particularly those with:


* **Varying shapes:**  Different gray object forms.
* **Size variations:** Larger and smaller gray objects.
* **Position changes:** Gray object positioned at different locations.
* **Discontinuous shapes:**  Gray objects with gaps or missing parts.

The provided examples hint at a relatively consistent and predictable transformation, making a robust hypothesis possible with a few more test cases.  The next step will be to formulate code to replicate the transformation.
