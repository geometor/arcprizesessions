The replacement pattern mirrors the shape of the original grey object.\n  transformation:\n    - Similar to example_1, the gray object is recolored.\n    - Azure and red colors replace gray maintaining the original shape.\n    - The red pixels fill the innermost part of the shape, with azure as the outer layer.  The pattern reflects across a vertical axis\n```\n\n**Revised Thoughts and Further Investigation:**\n\nThe pattern is solidifying.  The transformation consistently involves:\n\n1.  **Shape Preservation:** The shape of the gray object remains unchanged.\n2.  **Color Replacement:** Gray is replaced with a combination of azure and red.\n3.  **Internal Pattern:** Red forms an inner shape within the azure, mirroring the grey's basic form about a vertical axis.  The outer shell is always azure.\n\nTo further test and refine the hypothesis, more examples are needed, particularly those with:\n\n*   **Varying shapes:**  Different gray object forms.\n*   **Size variations:** Larger and smaller gray objects.\n*   **Position changes:** Gray object positioned at different locations.\n*   **Discontinuous shapes:**  Gray objects with gaps or missing parts.\n\nThe provided examples hint at a relatively consistent and predictable transformation, making a robust hypothesis possible with a few more test cases.  The next step will be to formulate code to replicate the transformation.\n"
