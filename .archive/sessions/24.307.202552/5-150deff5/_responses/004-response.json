            "text": "The transformation consistently involves a recoding of a gray object (color 5) into a combination of azure (color 8) and red (color 2). The shape of the gray object remains unchanged.  The red pixels always form the inner part of the transformed object, while the azure pixels form the outer layer.  The arrangement is always vertically symmetrical.\n\nThe algorithm appears to be:\n\n1. **Identify Gray Object:** Find all connected pixels with value 5.\n2. **Preserve Shape:** Maintain the precise shape and size of the gray object.\n3. **Inner/Outer Coloring:**  Replace the innermost gray pixels with red (2).  A pixel is considered \"innermost\" if its reflection across the vertical axis of symmetry also belongs to the gray object. The remaining gray pixels are replaced with azure (8).\n4. **Symmetry:** The resulting pattern exhibits perfect vertical reflection symmetry.\n\nThis consistent pattern holds true across variations in object size, shape, and position within the grid.  The transformation is deterministic and rule-based.  No other grid values are affected.\n"
