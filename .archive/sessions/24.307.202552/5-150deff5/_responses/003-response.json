The shape of the original gray object is perfectly preserved. The red pixels always constitute the inner part of the transformed object, while the azure pixels form the outer layer.  The arrangement displays a vertical reflection symmetry.\n\nThe transformation is deterministic and rule-based. The rules appear to be:\n\n1.  **Identify Gray Object:** Locate all connected gray pixels.\n2.  **Preserve Shape:** Maintain the exact shape and size of the gray object.\n3.  **Inner/Outer Coloring:**  Replace the inner-most gray pixels with red, and the remaining gray pixels with azure. The 'innermost' is determined by a vertical reflection about a central vertical axis. Pixels are considered 'inner' if their reflection is also part of the gray object.\n4.  **Symmetry:**  The final azure and red pattern displays reflection symmetry across a vertical axis.\n\n\nThis pattern holds across varying object sizes, shapes, and positions within the grid.  We can now proceed to the test phase with confidence in this hypothesis.\n"
