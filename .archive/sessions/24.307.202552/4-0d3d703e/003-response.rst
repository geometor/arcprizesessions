   example_3:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 5: 3
         - 8: 3
         - 6: 3
       objects:
         - color: gray, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: azure, size: 3x1, position: top-middle
         - color: magenta, size: 3x1, position: top-right

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 1: 3
         - 9: 3
         - 2: 3
       objects:
         - color: blue, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: maroon, size: 3x1, position: top-middle
         - color: red, size: 3x1, position: top-right

     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  The mapping is not a simple arithmetic operation.

     transformation:
       - The transformation is a color remapping. The mapping is 5->1, 8->9, 6->2.  This further reinforces the need for a lookup table or a more complex function to define the transformation rule.  There's no immediately obvious pattern beyond a case-by-case mapping.

Based on the three examples, the transformation is a deterministic color remapping.  However, the mapping is not consistently defined by a simple arithmetic operation.  Instead, a lookup table seems necessary.  To predict the output for a new input, a lookup table approach is required.  A more complex function might also be possible, but without more examples it's hard to determine a pattern that would allow us to define such a function.  The provided examples are insufficient to definitively determine if a broader mathematical pattern exists beyond the specific mappings observed.

Let's create a lookup table representing the transformation:



code_execution:



.. code-block:: python


   transformation_table = {
       1: 4,
       2: 5,
       3: 6,
       5: 1,
       6: 2,
       8: 9
   }



code_execution_result: 1



.. code-block::





This table shows the mapping of input colors to output colors for the values observed in the examples.  Any input color not present in this table would require further examples to be mapped correctly.
