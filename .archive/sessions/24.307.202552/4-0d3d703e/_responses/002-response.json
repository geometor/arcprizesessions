The mapping is not immediately obvious from a simple arithmetic operation.  A lookup table or a more complex function might be needed.\n```\n\nThe transformation in example 2 is also a color remapping, but it's not a simple addition like in example 1. The mapping is: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9. This suggests that a lookup table or a more complex function is necessary to describe the transformation.  It's not clear from just these two examples whether there's a consistent rule for this remapping beyond a case-by-case lookup.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a broader pattern.\n"
