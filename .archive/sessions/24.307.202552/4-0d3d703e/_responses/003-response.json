The mapping is not a simple arithmetic operation.\n\n  transformation:\n    - The transformation is a color remapping. The mapping is 5->1, 8->9, 6->2.  This further reinforces the need for a lookup table or a more complex function to define the transformation rule.  There's no immediately obvious pattern beyond a case-by-case mapping.\n```\n\nBased on the three examples, the transformation is a deterministic color remapping.  However, the mapping is not consistently defined by a simple arithmetic operation.  Instead, a lookup table seems necessary.  To predict the output for a new input, a lookup table approach is required.  A more complex function might also be possible, but without more examples it's hard to determine a pattern that would allow us to define such a function.  The provided examples are insufficient to definitively determine if a broader mathematical pattern exists beyond the specific mappings observed.\n\nLet's create a lookup table representing the transformation:\n\n"
