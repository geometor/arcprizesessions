   example_2:
     input:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 2: 3
         - 3: 3
         - 8: 3
       objects:
         - color: red, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: green, size: 3x1, position: top-middle
         - color: azure, size: 3x1, position: top-right

     output:
       width: 3
       height: 3
       colors:
         - 6: 3
         - 4: 3
         - 9: 3
       objects:
         - color: magenta, size: 3x1, position: top-left
         - color: yellow, size: 3x1, position: top-middle
         - color: maroon, size: 3x1, position: top-right

     differences:
       cells_changed: 9
       colors_changed: All cells changed to different colors.  The mapping isn't a simple addition as in example 1.

     transformation:
       - The transformation is a more complex remapping of colors.  The mapping is not immediately obvious from a simple arithmetic operation.  A lookup table or a more complex function might be needed.

The transformation in example 2 is also a color remapping, but it's not a simple addition like in example 1. The mapping is: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9. This suggests that a lookup table or a more complex function is necessary to describe the transformation.  It's not clear from just these two examples whether there's a consistent rule for this remapping beyond a case-by-case lookup.  More examples are needed to determine if there's a broader pattern.
