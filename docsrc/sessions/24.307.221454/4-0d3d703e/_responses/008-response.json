We need to either:\n\n1. **Obtain more examples:** Additional examples might reveal a pattern in the color mappings or a rule for handling unseen configurations.\n\n2. **Define a default behavior:**  We could specify a default behavior for unseen inputs, such as leaving the grid unchanged, filling it with a specific color, or applying a simple transformation (like a shift or mirroring).\n\n3. **Develop a more sophisticated model:** Instead of a simple lookup table, a more powerful model (e.g., a neural network) could be trained on the examples to learn the color mapping and generalize to unseen inputs.\n\nWithout further information or a strategy for handling unseen inputs, we cannot proceed with the transformation.  The current approach of using a lookup table is insufficient because the input configuration is not represented in the lookup table.  The error was correctly raised because the input color combination was not part of the training data.\n"
