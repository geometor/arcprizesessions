With 6 blue squares, we predict approximately 3 red squares.\n\n5. **Red Square Positioning:**  The placement of red squares is still uncertain, but the previous examples show a tendency towards corner placements and possibly a diagonal or symmetric layout.\n\n**Predictions:**\n\nGiven the limitations of the current hypothesis and the inconsistencies across the examples, several potential output patterns are possible.  To provide the most likely possibilities, I will generate several plausible options:\n\n**Possible Output 1 (Corner Emphasis):**\n\n```\n[[0 0 2]\n [0 0 0]\n [2 0 2]]\n```\n\n**Possible Output 2 (Diagonal Emphasis):**\n\n```\n[[0 0 2]\n [0 0 0]\n [2 0 0]]\n```\n\n**Possible Output 3 (Symmetrical):**\n\n```\n[[2 0 2]\n [0 0 0]\n [2 0 2]]\n```\n\n**Code Execution for Further Investigation:**\n\nLet's use Python to count the blue squares in the test input to confirm our count:\n\n\n"

            "text": "The code confirms there are 10 blue squares. This refines our prediction of red squares to approximately 5 (half of 10). However, a 3x3 grid can only hold a maximum of 9 squares.  This discrepancy suggests a further refinement of the rules is needed.\n\n**Revised Predictions (Considering Blue Square Count):**\n\nGiven that there are 10 blue squares, and a 3x3 grid only allows 9 squares, we need to revise our prediction. The most plausible prediction is that the maximum number of red squares is equal to or slightly less than the number of blue squares and the remaining squares are white. There is no clear way to decide the position of the red squares with our current knowledge, and the corner/symmetrical patterns are not strictly followed.  More information is needed to achieve a higher accuracy.\n\n\n**Possible Output 4 (Maximum Red Squares):**\n\n```\n[[2 2 2]\n [2 0 2]\n [2 2 2]]\n```\n\n**Possible Output 5 (Slightly fewer Red Squares):**\n\n```\n[[2 2 2]\n [2 0 0]\n [2 2 0]]\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe hypothesis needs further refinement to account for cases where the number of blue squares might exceed the available spaces in the 3x3 output. The positioning of the red squares is still unpredictable without additional examples. The test input revealed a limitation in our current understanding of the transformation rules. More examples are definitely needed to resolve the ambiguity of the red square placement.\n"
