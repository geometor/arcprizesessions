Specifically,  the  azure pixels at the top right corner and bottom left corner of the azure object are changed to blue.\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe core change is the replacement of two specific azure pixels with blue pixels. The locations of these changes seem related to the corners of the primary azure object. There's no obvious mathematical relationship or pattern besides this localized change.  Further examples are needed to determine if this is a consistent rule or a coincidence.\n"
