            "text": "The `set_pixel` function call correctly adds a yellow (4) block above the red (2) block at (3,2).  This aligns with the observed pattern of adding yellow blocks above and below existing colored blocks.  The `transform_grid_refined` function attempts to automate this process, but, as noted earlier, it doesn't perfectly capture all the nuances of the transformation.  Specifically, it doesn't handle all boundary conditions or situations involving multiple closely spaced colored cells accurately.\n\n\nTo proceed, I need more examples or a more precise description of the rules governing the placement of yellow and orange blocks to improve the `transform_grid_refined` function.  Without a complete rule set, manually setting pixels will be inefficient and prone to errors.  Therefore,  additional examples are strongly needed for a reliable solution.\n"
