This example introduces a new color, magenta (color 6), in addition to red (color 2) and blue (color 1). The input grid is 9x9, with a red pixel at [2,2], a blue pixel at [7,3], and a magenta pixel at [5,6]. 

The output grid again preserves the positions of these original non-white pixels. Red pixels are surrounded by yellow (color 4) pixels, and blue pixels are surrounded by orange (color 7) pixels. The magenta pixel remains unchanged, similar to how the azure pixel remained unchanged in the previous example. This further suggests that only red and blue pixels are being transformed.

Let's document the details in YAML format and verify our observations with code execution.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 9
     height: 9
     colors:
       0: 79
       1: 1
       2: 1
       6: 1
     objects:
       - 1x1, position [2,2], color red
       - 1x1, position [7,3], color blue
       - 1x1, position [5,6], color magenta

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
     width: 9
     height: 9
     colors:
       0: 71
       1: 1
       2: 1
       4: 4
       6: 1
       7: 4
     objects:
       - 1x1, position [2,2], color red
       - 1x1, position [7,3], color blue
       - 1x1, position [5,6], color magenta
       - 1x1, positions [1,1], [1,3], [3,1], [3,3], color yellow
       - 1x1, positions [6,3], [7,2], [7,4], [8,3], color orange

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: 8
     colors_changed: added yellow and orange
     transformation:
       - surround red pixels (color 2) with yellow pixels (color 4) in adjacent orthogonal positions.
       - surround blue pixels (color 1) with orange pixels (color 7) in adjacent orthogonal positions.
       - magenta pixels (color 6) remain unchanged.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   red_positions_input = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)
   blue_positions_input = np.argwhere(input_grid == 1)
   magenta_positions_input = np.argwhere(input_grid == 6)

   yellow_positions_output = np.argwhere(output_grid == 4)
   orange_positions_output = np.argwhere(output_grid == 7)

   print("Red pixel positions in input:", red_positions_input)
   print("Blue pixel positions in input:", blue_positions_input)
   print("Magenta pixel positions in input:", magenta_positions_input)
   print("Yellow pixel positions in output:", yellow_positions_output)
   print("Orange pixel positions in output:", orange_positions_output)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Red pixel positions in input: [[2 2]]
   Blue pixel positions in input: [[7 3]]
   Magenta pixel positions in input: [[5 6]]
   Yellow pixel positions in output: [[1 1]
    [1 3]
    [3 1]
    [3 3]]
   Orange pixel positions in output: [[6 3]
    [7 2]
    [7 4]
    [8 3]]

The code output confirms the positions of the red, blue, and magenta pixels in the input grid, and the positions of the newly added yellow and orange pixels in the output grid. As observed, yellow pixels surround the red pixel in the adjacent orthogonal positions, and orange pixels surround the blue pixel similarly. The magenta pixel remains unchanged.

The natural language program for this transformation, incorporating the finding that magenta pixels remain unchanged, is:

For each non-white pixel in the input grid:


#. If the pixel is red (color 2), place yellow pixels (color 4) in the adjacent orthogonal cells (up, down, left, right) if those cells are within the grid boundaries and are currently white (color 0).
#. If the pixel is blue (color 1), place orange pixels (color 7) in the adjacent orthogonal cells (up, down, left, right) if those cells are within the grid boundaries and are currently white (color 0).
#. If the pixel is magenta (color 6), do nothing (leave it unchanged). 

This program accurately describes the transformation from the input to the output grid in this example.
