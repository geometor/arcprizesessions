This puzzle presents two grids, an input and an output, both 9x9. The input grid has a red pixel (color 2) at position [3,2] and a blue pixel (color 1) at [6,6]. The rest are white (color 0). 

The output grid maintains the red and blue pixels in their original positions. However, new pixels have been added. Yellow pixels (color 4) appear at [2,1], [2,3], [4,1], and [4,3] forming a square around the red pixel. Orange pixels (color 7) have been added around the blue pixel at [6,5], [6,7], [7,6], and [8,6].

It seems that the transformation rule is to place a specific color pixel in the adjacent orthogonal positions of a non-white pixel. The color to place is determined by the original non-white pixel's color: red is surrounded by yellow and blue is surrounded by orange.

The code output confirms the positions of the red and blue pixels in the input grid, and the positions of the newly added yellow and orange pixels in the output grid. The yellow pixels surround the red pixel in the adjacent orthogonal positions, and the orange pixels surround the blue pixel similarly.

The natural language program for this transformation is:

For each non-white pixel in the input grid:


#. If the pixel is red (color 2), place yellow pixels (color 4) in the adjacent orthogonal cells (up, down, left, right) if those cells are within the grid boundaries and are currently white (color 0).
#. If the pixel is blue (color 1), place orange pixels (color 7) in the adjacent orthogonal cells (up, down, left, right) if those cells are within the grid boundaries and are currently white (color 0).

This program accurately describes the transformation from the input to the output grid in the given example.
