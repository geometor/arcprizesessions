            "text": "Ruminating on the three examples provided, the transformation appears consistent and straightforward. The core rule is that red pixels (color 2) in the input grid become surrounded by yellow pixels (color 4) in the output grid, and blue pixels (color 1) become surrounded by orange pixels (color 7). All other colors remain unchanged. The surrounding pixels are placed orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the original pixel, only if those adjacent cells are within the grid boundaries and are initially white (color 0).\n\nThe natural language program describing this transformation is as follows:\n\n```\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n1. If the cell is red (color 2):\n   a. Place yellow (color 4) in the orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), provided they are within the grid boundaries and are currently white (color 0).\n2. If the cell is blue (color 1):\n   a. Place orange (color 7) in the orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), provided they are within the grid boundaries and are currently white (color 0).\n3. Otherwise (for any other color including white):\n   a. Leave the cell unchanged.\n```\n\nLet's verify this program with a code execution block that applies the transformation to an arbitrary input grid and checks if it produces the expected output.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 2:  # Red\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and output_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = 4  # Yellow\n            elif input_grid[r, c] == 1:  # Blue\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and output_grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                        output_grid[nr, nc] = 7  # Orange\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test with example 2\ninput_grid_example2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\noutput_grid_example2 = transform_grid(input_grid_example2)\nprint(output_grid_example2)\n```\n"
