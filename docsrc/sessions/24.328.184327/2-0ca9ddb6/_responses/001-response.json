The rest are white (color 0). \n\nThe output grid maintains the red and blue pixels in their original positions. However, new pixels have been added. Yellow pixels (color 4) appear at [2,1], [2,3], [4,1], and [4,3] forming a square around the red pixel. Orange pixels (color 7) have been added around the blue pixel at [6,5], [6,7], [7,6], and [8,6].\n\nIt seems that the transformation rule is to place a specific color pixel in the adjacent orthogonal positions of a non-white pixel. The color to place is determined by the original non-white pixel's color: red is surrounded by yellow and blue is surrounded by orange.\n\n```yaml\ninput:\n  width: 9\n  height: 9\n  colors:\n    0: 79\n    1: 1\n    2: 1\n  objects:\n    - 1x1, position [3,2], color red\n    - 1x1, position [6,6], color blue\n```\n\n```yaml\noutput:\n  width: 9\n  height: 9\n  colors:\n    0: 71\n    1: 1\n    2: 1\n    4: 4\n    7: 4\n  objects:\n    - 1x1, position [3,2], color red\n    - 1x1, position [6,6], color blue\n    - 1x1, positions [2,1], [2,3], [4,1], [4,3], color yellow\n    - 1x1, positions [6,5], [6,7], [7,6], [8,6], color orange\n```\n\n```yaml\ndifferences:\n  cells_changed: 8\n  colors_changed: added yellow and orange\n  transformation:\n    - surround red pixels (color 2) with yellow pixels (color 4) in adjacent orthogonal positions.\n    - surround blue pixels (color 1) with orange pixels (color 7) in adjacent orthogonal positions.\n```\n"
