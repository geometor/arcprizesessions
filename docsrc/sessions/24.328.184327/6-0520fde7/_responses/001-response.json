It contains the following colors:\n\n- Blue (1)\n- White (0)\n- Gray (5)\n\nThere are several blue and white pixels scattered throughout the grid. There is a vertical column of gray (5) in the center of the grid.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\nThe output grid is a 3x3 grid. It contains the following colors:\n\n- White (0)\n- Red (2)\n\nThe output grid has a single red pixel (2) in the center, surrounded by white pixels (0).\n\nIt appears the transformation involves a significant reduction in size from a 3x7 grid to a 3x3 grid and a change in colors. Let's use `code_execution` to analyze the grids further.\n\n```yaml\ninput:\n  width: 7\n  height: 3\n  colors:\n    - 1: 6  # Blue\n    - 0: 11 # White\n    - 5: 4  # Gray\n  objects:\n    - Scattered blue and white pixels, a vertical column of gray in the center.\n```\n\n```yaml\noutput:\n  width: 3\n  height: 3\n  colors:\n    - 0: 8 # White\n    - 2: 1 # Red\n  objects:\n    - Single red pixel in the center, surrounded by white.\n```\n\n```yaml\ndifferences:\n  cells_changed: 12 # Assuming the output is overlayed on the input, aligning the center\n  colors_changed: Blue (1) and Gray (5) are removed, Red (2) is introduced.\ntransformation:\n  - The grid is reduced in size from 7x3 to 3x3.\n  - The central pixel of the output is changed to red (2).\n  - All other pixels become white (0).\n  - The specific rule determining the red pixel needs further investigation.\n```\n\n"
