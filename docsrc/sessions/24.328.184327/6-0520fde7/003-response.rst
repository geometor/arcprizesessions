**Observations for Example 3:**

**Input Grid:**

The input grid for example 3 is, again, a 3x7 grid. The colors present are:


* Blue (1)
* White (0)
* Gray (5)

The structure follows the pattern observed in previous examples: a vertical column of gray (5) in the center with varying arrangements of blue and white pixels.

**Output Grid:**

The output grid for example 3 is a 3x3 grid containing:


* White (0)
* Red (2)

In this case, there are two red pixels (2) located at positions (1, 0) and (2, 2), with the remaining pixels being white (0).

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 10 # White
       - 1: 7  # Blue
       - 5: 3  # Gray
     objects:
       - Scattered blue and white pixels, a vertical column of gray in the center.

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 7  # White
       - 2: 2  # Red
     objects:
       - Two red pixels at specific positions, remaining pixels are white.

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: 12 # Assuming the output is overlayed on the input, aligning the center
     colors_changed: Blue (1) and Gray (5) are removed, Red (2) is introduced at specific positions.
   transformation:
     - The grid is reduced in size from 7x3 to 3x3.
     - The pattern of red pixel placement needs to be determined based on the input grid.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   # Input grid
   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                          [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                          [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])

   # Output grid
   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                           [2, 0, 0],
                           [0, 0, 2]])

   # Find the position of the gray column (color 5) in the input grid
   gray_column_indices = np.where(input_grid == 5)[1]
   print(f"Gray column indices in input: {gray_column_indices}")

   # Find the positions of the red pixels (color 2) in the output grid
   red_pixel_positions = np.where(output_grid == 2)
   print(f"Red pixel positions in output: {red_pixel_positions}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block:: text

   Gray column indices in input: [3 3 3]
   Red pixel positions in output: (array([1, 2]), array([0, 2]))

**Analysis of Code Execution Output:**


* The gray column (color 5) is located at index 3 (the fourth column), consistent with previous examples.
* The red pixels (color 2) are located at positions (1, 0) and (2, 2) in the output grid.

**Further Analysis and Refinement of Hypothesis:**

In this example, the red pixels are not in a straight line as in example 2. This suggests the rule for placing red pixels is dependent on the specific arrangement of blue pixels around the gray column in the input grid. We need to analyze the input patterns to determine the exact rule.

Possible patterns to consider:


#. **Count of Adjacent Blue Pixels:** Examine the number of blue pixels adjacent to the gray column in each row of the input.
#. **Position of Blue Pixels:** Determine the positions of blue pixels relative to the gray column in each row.

We need to identify a rule that consistently explains the placement of red pixels in all examples so far. 

The next step will be the rumination phase, where we will analyze all examples to identify a consistent pattern and define the transformation rules more accurately.
