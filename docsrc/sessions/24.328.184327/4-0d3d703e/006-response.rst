**Observations**

The test input grid is a 3x3 array with vertical stripes of azure (8), blue (1), and green (3). Based on the established transformation pattern, we need to determine a unique color mapping for these colors to generate the output grid. 

We will follow the natural language program established in the rumination phase:


#. Identify the unique colors present in the input grid.
#. Create a unique color mapping for each unique input color to an output color.
#. Replace every cell in the input grid with its mapped color to create the output grid.
#. Maintain the 3x3 structure and vertical stripe pattern.

However, since the output is not provided, we must create a mapping, ensuring each unique input color maps to a unique output color not already present in the input grid.

Let's choose the mapping:


* 8 -> 2 (azure to red)
* 1 -> 4 (blue to yellow)
* 3 -> 5 (green to gray)

Based on this mapping, the output grid should be:

.. code-block::

   [[2 4 5]
    [2 4 5]
    [2 4 5]]

**Final Answer:**

The final output grid is:

.. code-block::

   [[2 4 5]
    [2 4 5]
    [2 4 5]]
