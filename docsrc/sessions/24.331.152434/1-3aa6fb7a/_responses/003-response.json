This rule applies to each light blue cell individually, regardless of the overall pattern or cluster size.\n\nThe code confirms this by identifying the changed cells and their locations, showing that only light blue cells adjacent to white cells are affected.  The number of cells changed varies depending on the input grid's arrangement of light blue cells and their proximity to white cells.\n\nTo summarize: The transformation is a local, edge-detection rule applying only to light blue pixels which are adjacent to a white pixel.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with a function:\n\n\n"
