            "text": "The `set_pixel` function call correctly updates the `working_output` grid by setting the pixel at row 0, column 2 to color 8 (light blue).  This is a single step in the transformation process.  To continue, I need a more complete algorithm that encompasses the mirroring and alternating color placement rules inferred from the examples.\n\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output = np.array([[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Output Shape:\", working_output.shape)\nunique_colors = np.unique(working_output)\nprint(\"Unique Colors:\", unique_colors)\nprint(\"Number of color 8 pixels:\", np.count_nonzero(working_output == 8))\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Output Shape: (8, 11)\nUnique Colors: [0 8]\nNumber of color 8 pixels: 1\n```\nThe code verifies that the `working_output` grid is 8x11 and contains only colors 0 and 8, with a single instance of color 8.  This confirms the single pixel update was successful.  The next step is to create a more sophisticated algorithm for mirroring and alternating colors.  I would need to use more advanced image processing techniques or develop custom logic to reflect the shape and apply alternating colors accurately.  The complexity of this task is significant and would require a more powerful toolset.\n"
