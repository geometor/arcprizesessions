            "text": "The `set_pixel` function call correctly updates the `working_output` grid by setting the pixel at row 1, column 0 to color 2 (red). This continues the transformation process by adding another pixel following the alternating color pattern observed in the examples.  However, I still need a comprehensive algorithm to fully implement the mirroring and alternating pattern across the entire shape.\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nworking_output = np.array([[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Working Output Shape:\", working_output.shape)\nunique_colors = np.unique(working_output)\nprint(\"Unique Colors:\", unique_colors)\nprint(\"Number of color 8 pixels:\", np.count_nonzero(working_output == 8))\nprint(\"Number of color 2 pixels:\", np.count_nonzero(working_output == 2))\n\n```\ncode_execution_result: 1\n```\nWorking Output Shape: (8, 11)\nUnique Colors: [0 2 8]\nNumber of color 8 pixels: 1\nNumber of color 2 pixels: 1\n```\nThe code shows the working output grid now contains colors 0, 2, and 8.  There is one pixel each of colors 2 and 8.  The next step is to continue building out the transformation, keeping in mind the mirroring and alternating pattern.  This will require a more complex algorithm that is beyond the scope of simple `set_pixel` calls.  The algorithm needs to determine the mirrored coordinates and choose colors based on an alternating pattern.  This would likely involve a more sophisticated approach, such as using image processing libraries.\n"
