Each mapping seems arbitrary.  To predict the output for a new input, one would need to identify the specific mapping rule applied to that particular input. There is no global, consistent mapping rule across all four examples.  The transformation is entirely determined by the specific mapping for the input.  Therefore, a general natural language program to describe this transformation is difficult to formulate.  A program would need to be created for each unique mapping rather than a general algorithm.\n\nTo reiterate: Each example represents a unique mapping and therefore a unique transformation story. There is no overarching rule to predict the transformation without knowing the specific color mapping used in the puzzle.\n"
