The current working output grid ``[[8 9 3], [0 9 3], [0 9 3]]`` is based on the assumption that the transformation involves a column-wise color mapping, where each input column maps to a specific output column with a unique color. However, this is a conjecture; there's no guarantee this is correct, as the previous examples showed no such consistent rule. Each example had a completely unique color mapping.

The current assignments are:


* Input color 8 (azure) maps to output color 8.
* Input color 1 (blue) maps to output color 9 (maroon).
* Input color 3 (green) maps to output color 3 (green).

There is no consistency in these mappings with the previous examples.

Let's investigate further using code:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[8, 1, 3],
                        [8, 1, 3],
                        [8, 1, 3]])

   output_grid = np.array([[8, 9, 3],
                          [0, 9, 3],
                          [0, 9, 3]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid (Working):\n", output_grid)

   mapping = {}
   for i in range(3):
       if output_grid[0, i] != 0:  # Skip unmapped columns
         mapping[input_grid[0, i]] = output_grid[0, i]


   print("\nPartial Mapping (from top row):", mapping)

   consistent = True
   for row in range(3):
       for col in range(3):
           if input_grid[row, col] in mapping and mapping[input_grid[row, col]] != output_grid[row, col]:
               consistent = False
               break
       if not consistent:
           break

   print(f"\nConsistent Mapping (Partially checked): {consistent}")

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]

   Output Grid (Working):
    [[8 9 3]
    [0 9 3]
    [0 9 3]]

   Partial Mapping (from top row): {8: 8, 1: 9, 3: 3}

   Consistent Mapping (Partially checked): False

The code shows that even the partial mapping from the top row is inconsistent because the bottom two rows do not match the suggested mapping from the top row.  The "column-wise mapping" hypothesis is refuted.  The solution is likely to be completely different.  Without further examples or a direct indication of the mapping rule, any further attempts to complete the working output grid would be mere speculation.  More information is crucial.
