The transformation from input to output grids involves a consistent set of operations:


#. 
   **Size Reduction:** The input grid (always 3x7) is reduced to a 3x3 output grid.  The central 3x3 section of the input is relevant to the output.

#. 
   **Color Replacement:**


   * Blue (1) pixels are removed.
   * Gray (5) pixels are replaced by white (0) pixels.

#. 
   **Red Pixel Addition:** Red (2) pixels are added to the 3x3 output grid. The pattern of red pixel placement varies across examples:


   * **Example 1:** One central red pixel.
   * **Example 2:** A symmetrical cross pattern of red pixels.
   * **Example 3:** Red pixels at corners (1,0) and (2,2).

The positioning of the red pixels seems to depend on the distribution of blue pixels in the input grid's central 3x3 region.  A more sophisticated analysis is needed to determine the precise rules governing red pixel placement.  However, we can formulate a preliminary natural language program that takes into account these three steps:

**Natural Language Program (Preliminary):**


#. Reduce the input grid to its central 3x3 section.
#. Replace all gray pixels in the reduced grid with white pixels.
#. Remove all blue pixels.
#. Add red pixels based on the pattern observed in the examples (requires further analysis to define a precise rule).

**Code Execution (Further Analysis):**

The following code analyzes the relationship between the blue pixels in the input's central 3x3 section and the red pixel placement in the output.

   import numpy as np

   def analyze_transformation(input_grid):
       # Reduce to 3x3
       reduced_grid = input_grid[1:4, 2:5]

       # Replace gray with white
       reduced_grid[reduced_grid == 5] = 0

       # Remove blue
       reduced_grid[reduced_grid == 1] = 0

       # Analyze for red placement patterns (This needs further refinement)
       blue_count = np.sum(input_grid[1:4,2:5]==1)
       if blue_count==0:
          output = np.zeros((3,3))
          output[1,1]=2 #central red
       elif blue_count == 4:
          output = np.zeros((3,3))
          output[[0,2],1] = 2 # vertical
          output[1,0] = 2 #vertical
          output[1,2] = 2 #vertical
       elif blue_count == 3:
           output = np.zeros((3,3))
           output[1,0]=2
           output[2,2]=2 # corner red
       else:
           output = np.zeros((3,3)) #Handle other patterns as needed

       return output

   # Test with the examples
   input1 = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                      [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                      [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]])
   output1 = analyze_transformation(input1)
   print("Example 1 Output:\n",output1)

   input2 = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                      [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                      [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]])
   output2 = analyze_transformation(input2)
   print("\nExample 2 Output:\n",output2)


   input3 = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                      [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                      [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])
   output3 = analyze_transformation(input3)
   print("\nExample 3 Output:\n",output3)

   Example 1 Output:
    [[0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 2. 0.]
    [0. 0. 0.]]

   Example 2 Output:
    [[0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 2. 0.]
    [0. 0. 0.]]

   Example 3 Output:
    [[0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 2. 0.]
    [0. 0. 0.]]






The refined code attempts to determine red pixel placement based on the number of blue pixels in the central 3x3 region of the input grid. However, the current rule for red pixel placement is incomplete and inaccurate; it doesn't perfectly reproduce the outputs of Examples 2 and 3. The conditional logic needs further refinement based on a more thorough analysis of the examples and possibly additional examples to cover all the variations in the distribution of the blue pixels.  A more sophisticated approach, perhaps involving pattern recognition or machine learning techniques, may be required to accurately capture the red pixel placement rules.
