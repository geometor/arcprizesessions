The working output grid now has a single red (2) pixel at the center (row 1, column 1).  This is consistent with the predicted output from the ``analyze_transformation`` function and Example 1, where there is a central red pixel when there are 2 blue pixels in the central 3x3 region of the input grid.  However, it's crucial to reiterate that the ``analyze_transformation`` function is still incomplete, and this prediction should be considered provisional.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 2, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)
   print("\nWorking Output Grid Shape:", working_output.shape)
   print("\nUnique values in Working Output Grid:", np.unique(working_output))
   print("\nWorking Output Color Counts:", np.bincount(working_output.flatten()))

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Working Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0]
    [0 2 0]
    [0 0 0]]

   Working Output Grid Shape: (3, 3)

   Unique values in Working Output Grid: [0 2]

   Working Output Color Counts: [8 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

The code confirms the update: a single red pixel (2) is now present in the center of the 3x3 grid, and there are 8 white pixels and 1 red pixel.  The next step would be to further refine the ``analyze_transformation`` function to handle other patterns of blue pixels in the central 3x3 region of the input grid more accurately.  More examples would be very beneficial for this purpose.
