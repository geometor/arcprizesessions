.. code-block::

   Differences at rows: [0 0 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6], columns: [5 6 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 1]
   Values changed from [8 8 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 8 8] to [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
   Pixel at (0,5) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (0,6) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (1,1) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (1,2) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (2,0) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (3,1) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (3,2) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (4,0) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (5,1) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (6,0) adjacent to white: True
   Pixel at (6,1) adjacent to white: True

   Number of remaining azure pixels: 6

The code confirms that all changes made so far are consistent with the rule:  Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels have been correctly changed to blue. There are 6 azure pixels remaining.  Let's examine them to see if any are adjacent to white pixels.
