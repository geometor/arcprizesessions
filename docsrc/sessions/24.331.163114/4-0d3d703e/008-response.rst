The working output grid has been initialized as a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white), representing an empty grid. This is a correct starting point for applying the transformation, as we are expecting a 3x3 output grid based on the examples.  The color mapping is yet to be determined, which is the next step.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0]])

   print("Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)

   #The working output grid is currently empty (all 0s).  Further analysis and code is needed to fill the grid based on the input grid and a determined (or hypothesized) color mapping.

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Working Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0]
    [0 0 0]
    [0 0 0]]

The code confirms the working output grid is correctly initialized.  The next step is to analyze the input grid and apply a color mapping based on the observed patterns in the examples.  Due to the lack of a deterministic mapping rule, I'll use a hypothetical mapping as a working assumption.  However, this will not necessarily produce a correct result, and more examples would be needed to establish a more certain mapping strategy.
