Based on the previous examples, the transformation appears to be a permutation of colors, maintaining the columnar structure.  Let's analyze the test input and predict the output.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 3]])
   print("Test Input:\n", test_input)

   # Analyzing previous examples to find a pattern in color mappings is proving difficult.  The mappings seem arbitrary.

   #Let's try to establish color mapping based on previous examples.  However, note that there may not be a consistent, predictable mapping across all inputs.
   # Example 1: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}
   # Example 2: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}
   # Example 3: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}
   # Example 4: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}

   # There's no obvious pattern in how colors are mapped.  Therefore I will attempt a mapping based on a different permutation.

   #I will arbitrarily select a color mapping to apply to the test input based on examples.  This approach is not ideal due to lack of predictable color permutation pattern.

   #Here is a test using a hypothetical color mapping.

   test_mapping = {8:9, 1:5, 3:4}
   test_output = np.array([[test_mapping[x] for x in row] for row in test_input])

   print("\nTest Output (using a hypothetical mapping):\n", test_output)

.. code-block::

   Test Input:
    [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]

   Test Output (using a hypothetical mapping):
    [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 8: 9
       - 1: 9
       - 3: 9
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: column 1, color: azure
       - size: 3x1, position: column 2, color: blue
       - size: 3x1, position: column 3, color: green

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 9: 9
       - 5: 9
       - 4: 9
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: column 1, color: maroon
       - size: 3x1, position: column 2, color: gray
       - size: 3x1, position: column 3, color: yellow

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All cells changed, consistent column-wise mapping.

   transformation:
     - The transformation is a color permutation.  The columns remain the same, but the color in each column is changed according to an apparently arbitrary mapping.  Based on previous examples, a similar pattern is predicted here,  although a definitive rule for predicting the specific mapping cannot be established with certainty based only on the provided examples.

The test output is a prediction based on the observed pattern in the examples,  namely a color permutation that preserves the columnar structure of the grid.  However,  due to the lack of a clearly defined rule for determining the specific permutation,  the prediction is inherently uncertain.  More examples are needed to define a more robust and predictable transformation rule.
