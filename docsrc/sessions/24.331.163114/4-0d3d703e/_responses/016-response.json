            "text": "The final working output grid is incorrect.  The `set_range` function call overwrote the previously correctly mapped columns.  The issue stems from the lack of a deterministic rule for determining the color mapping.  My approach was to hypothesize a mapping based on the examples, but this proved insufficient.  The examples do not reveal a consistent mapping pattern across all inputs, making it impossible to reliably predict the output without a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying transformation.\n\n\nThe final output grid should have been `[[9 5 4],[9 5 4],[9 5 4]]` based on my initial hypothetical mapping.  The use of `set_range` to fill entire columns at once led to incorrect overwriting of the correctly-determined first column.  A more iterative approach, setting individual pixels one by one according to the hypothesized mapping, would have been safer but still would not guarantee correctness due to the inherent uncertainty in the mapping.\n\nTo improve the solution, more examples are needed to identify the pattern of the color permutation.  Currently, there's not enough information to reliably establish a deterministic rule for mapping input colors to output colors.  The system's behavior appears to rely on something beyond a simple, easily defined color substitution.  Further investigation using more examples is crucial.\n"
