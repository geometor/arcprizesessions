The current working grid shows a single red pixel in the top-left corner. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a roughly symmetrical distribution of blue pixels around the central gray column in the input leads to red pixels in the corners of the 3x3 output grid. The test case showed this to be true, so the current step is consistent.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   # Current working output grid
   working_grid = np.array([[2, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0],
                            [0, 0, 0]])

   # Function to analyze symmetry of blue pixels (from previous code)
   def analyze_blue_symmetry(input_grid):
       gray_col_index = np.where(input_grid == 5)[1][0]
       center_x = input_grid.shape[0] // 2
       center_y = gray_col_index
       blue_pixels = np.where(input_grid == 1)
       blue_pixel_positions = list(zip(blue_pixels[0], blue_pixels[1]))

       relative_positions = []
       for x, y in blue_pixel_positions:
           relative_x = x - center_x
           relative_y = y - center_y
           relative_positions.append((relative_x, relative_y))

       #check for symmetry
       symmetric = True
       for x,y in relative_positions:
           if (x, -y) not in relative_positions or (-x, y) not in relative_positions or (-x,-y) not in relative_positions:
               symmetric = False
               break
       return symmetric


   input_grid = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [1, 0, 1, 5, 0, 1, 0]])

   symmetry = analyze_blue_symmetry(input_grid)
   print(f"Blue pixel symmetry: {symmetry}")

   #Check for corners
   corners_match = np.array_equal(working_grid[[0,2],[0,2]],np.array([[2,0],[0,2]]))

   print(f"Corner match: {corners_match}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Blue pixel symmetry: False
   Corner match: False

The code confirms that the current working grid does *not* fully match the predicted output grid, which should have red pixels in all four corners. The ``corners_match`` check specifically shows a mismatch. The ``analyze_blue_symmetry`` function again shows that the blue pixel distribution isn't perfectly symmetric, despite a degree of approximate symmetry. This suggests the rule for red pixel placement is more nuanced than initially thought.  More examples are needed to refine the hypothesis and create a reliable rule.
