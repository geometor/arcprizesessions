**observations**






The input grid is a 4x4 grid containing the colors blue, yellow, pink, and maroon.  The output grid is also a 4x4 grid, but the non-zero values from the input grid have been moved to the bottom row.  Specifically, the bottom row of the output grid contains the non-zero values of the input grid in the order they appear from left to right in the bottom-most row, and then from left to right in the third row, then the first row.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 4, 0, 9],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 4, 6, 0],
                         [1, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 4, 0, 0],
                          [1, 4, 6, 9]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   input_nonzero = input_grid[np.nonzero(input_grid)]
   output_bottom_row = output_grid[-1,:]

   print("\nNon-zero elements from input grid:", input_nonzero)
   print("\nBottom row of output grid:", output_bottom_row)

   #Check if non-zero elements are equal to output's bottom row
   are_equal = np.array_equal(input_nonzero, output_bottom_row)
   print(f"\nAre non-zero elements of input equal to output's bottom row?: {are_equal}")






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Input Grid:
    [[0 4 0 9]
    [0 0 0 0]
    [0 4 6 0]
    [1 0 0 0]]

   Output Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0]
    [0 4 0 0]
    [1 4 6 9]]

   Non-zero elements from input grid: [4 9 4 6 1]

   Bottom row of output grid: [1 4 6 9]

   Are non-zero elements of input equal to output's bottom row?: False






The code shows that the non-zero elements from the input are not directly equal to the output bottom row. My initial observation was incorrect. Let's re-examine.  The transformation appears to be moving all non-zero elements to the bottom row,  concatenating them from the last row, then the second to last, etc.,  from left to right within each row.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 4
     height: 4
     colors:
       - 0: 12
       - 1: 1
       - 4: 2
       - 6: 1
       - 9: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,3), color: maroon
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: pink
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

   output:
     width: 4
     height: 4
     colors:
       - 0: 12
       - 1: 1
       - 4: 2
       - 6: 1
       - 9: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: pink
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow

   differences:
     cells_changed: 11
     colors_changed: Non-zero values moved to bottom row.
   transformation:
     - Move all non-zero elements to the bottom row, concatenating them from bottom row upwards, maintaining left-to-right order.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
