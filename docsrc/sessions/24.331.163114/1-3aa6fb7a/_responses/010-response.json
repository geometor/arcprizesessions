            "text": "The change at `(1, 0)` is consistent with the observed pattern, as this azure pixel is adjacent to other azure pixels. However, I still need more examples to confidently determine the transformation rule.  My current hypothesis is that the rule involves cluster proximity and potentially other factors like cluster size or shape, but I can't definitively confirm this without further data.\n\nLet's investigate some properties of the current working grid and compare to the examples:\n\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n\ndef analyze_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    clusters = []\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:\n                cluster = []\n                q = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)\n                    cluster.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and \\\n                           grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                clusters.append(cluster)\n    return clusters\n\ndef calculate_intercluster_distances(clusters):\n    if not clusters:\n        return []\n    num_clusters = len(clusters)\n    distances = []\n    for i in range(num_clusters):\n        for j in range(i + 1, num_clusters):\n            cluster1_coords = np.array(clusters[i])\n            cluster2_coords = np.array(clusters[j])\n            min_dist = np.min(cdist(cluster1_coords, cluster2_coords))\n            distances.append(min_dist)\n    return distances\n\nworking_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n                      [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\nclusters = analyze_grid(working_grid)\nprint(f\"Clusters in working grid: {clusters}\")\nintercluster_distances = calculate_intercluster_distances(clusters)\nprint(f\"Inter-cluster distances in working grid: {intercluster_distances}\")\n\n\n```code_execution_result: 1\n```\nClusters in working grid: [[(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)], [(0, 5)]]\nInter-cluster distances in working grid: [0.0]\n```\n\nThe analysis shows that even after the transformation, the clusters maintain their proximity.  The inter-cluster distances remain unchanged.  This further suggests that the transformation is related to cluster adjacency, but the precise rule still eludes me.  Additional examples are absolutely essential to gain a complete understanding of the transformation logic.\n"
