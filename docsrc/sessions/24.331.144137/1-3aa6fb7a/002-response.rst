The input grid is a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming three L-shapes of different orientations. The output grid is also a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming the same L-shapes. However, one pixel in each L-shape has been changed from azure (8) to blue (1). Specifically, the "elbow" pixel of each L-shape has been changed.

       - 3-pixel L-shape at (5,3) with elbow in blue, rest azure
   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: azure (8) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - Identify L-shapes formed by azure pixels.
     - Locate the "elbow" pixel of each L-shape, defined as the pixel where the horizontal and vertical segments meet and which is not part of the L-shape itself.
     - Change the color of the "elbow" pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

The natural language program for the transformation is:


#. **Identify L-Shapes:** Find all L-shaped groups of azure (8) pixels.
#. **Locate Elbow Pixels:** For each L-shape, find the pixel at the "elbow" where the vertical and horizontal segments meet and which is not part of the L-shape itself but is adjacent to the elbow.
#. **Change Elbow Color:** Change the color of each identified "elbow" pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).
