The working output grid is currently all white (0).  My prediction, based on the analysis of the examples and the test input's central 3x3 region (containing 3 blue pixels), is that three red (2) pixels should form an L-shape in the 3x3 output.

Let's use code to modify the working output grid according to this prediction:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

   # Apply L-shape pattern of red pixels (2)
   working_output[0, 1] = 2
   working_output[1, 2] = 2
   working_output[2, 1] = 2

   print("Updated Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block::

   Updated Working Output Grid:
    [[0 2 0]
    [0 0 2]
    [0 2 0]]

The code has successfully updated the working output grid to reflect the predicted L-shaped pattern of red pixels.  This matches the prediction made based on the analysis of the previous examples.  The final output grid is now consistent with the rule derived from the examples.  The number of blue pixels (3) in the central 3x3 region of the test input led to this specific pattern in the output.
