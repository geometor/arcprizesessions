**Example 2 Analysis**

The input grid is a 3x7 grid consisting of blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The gray pixels again form a vertical central line, with blue pixels clustered around it, similar to Example 1.

The output grid is a 3x3 grid. It contains white (0) and red (2) pixels.  Three red pixels are arranged in an L-shape pattern.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1],
                         [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 2, 0],
                          [0, 0, 2],
                          [0, 2, 0]])

   print("Input Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)

   print("\nInput Grid Color Counts:")
   for color, count in np.nditer(np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)):
       print(f"{color}: {count}")

   print("\nOutput Grid Color Counts:")
   for color, count in np.nditer(np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True)):
       print(f"{color}: {count}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 8
       - 1: 10
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: center, color: gray
       - size: various, position: around central gray line, color: blue

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 6
       - 2: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: L-shape around center, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: Gray and blue pixels are replaced by white and red pixels forming an L shape.
   transformation:
     - The input grid is reduced in size.
     - The gray column is replaced, and some nearby pixels are changed to red pixels forming an L shape.
     - The remaining pixels are set to white.

The transformation in this example is similar to the first, with grid size reduction.  However, instead of a single central red pixel, we see three red pixels forming an "L" shape. The positions of the red pixels seem related to the positions of the blue and gray pixels in the input. A more refined natural language program might be: "Reduce the grid size; replace the central gray column and some adjacent pixels with red pixels forming an 'L' shape; fill the rest with white."
