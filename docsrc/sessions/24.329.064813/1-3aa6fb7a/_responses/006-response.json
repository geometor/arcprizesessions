            "text": "The working output grid is currently identical to the test input grid.  No changes have been made yet.  To proceed, I need to apply the transformation rules encoded in the refined natural language program (v2) and the associated Python code.\n\nLet's execute the code to transform the test input grid and then review the results.\n\ncode_execution:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    new_grid = np.copy(grid)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:\n                cluster = find_cluster(grid, r, c, visited)\n                if len(cluster) > 1:\n                    pixel_to_change = select_pixel(cluster, grid)\n                    if pixel_to_change:\n                        new_grid[pixel_to_change[0], pixel_to_change[1]] = 1\n\n    return new_grid\n\ndef find_cluster(grid, r, c, visited):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    queue = deque([(r, c)])\n    visited[r, c] = True\n    cluster = [(r, c)]\n\n    while queue:\n        row, col = queue.popleft()\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                cluster.append((nr, nc))\n    return cluster\n\ndef select_pixel(cluster, grid):\n    # Calculate centroid\n    x_coords, y_coords = zip(*cluster)\n    centroid_x = np.mean(x_coords)\n    centroid_y = np.mean(y_coords)\n\n    # Find distances from centroid\n    distances = [((x - centroid_x)**2 + (y - centroid_y)**2)**0.5 for x, y in cluster]\n    max_distance = max(distances)\n    farthest_pixels = [cluster[i] for i, dist in enumerate(distances) if dist == max_distance]\n\n\n    #Prioritize bottom/left among farthest\n    best_pixel = None\n    min_dist_to_border = float('inf')\n    for pixel in farthest_pixels:\n        r,c = pixel\n        dist = min(r,c, grid.shape[0]-1-r, grid.shape[1]-1-c)\n        if dist < min_dist_to_border:\n            min_dist_to_border = dist\n            best_pixel = pixel\n\n\n    return best_pixel\n\n\n\ntest_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n                      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n                      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                      [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(f\"Transformed Test Grid:\\n{transformed_grid}\")\n\n```\ncode_execution_result:\n```\nTransformed Test Grid:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]\n [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\nThe code has produced a transformed grid.  Three azure pixels have changed to blue, consistent with the observed pattern in previous examples. The selection seems reasonable based on the algorithm's logic (prioritizing pixels further from the centroid and closer to the edges).  Without a provided solution, it's impossible to definitively confirm its correctness for this specific test case, but the transformation appears plausible given the rules derived from previous examples.\n\n**working output grid**\n\n```\n[[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]\n [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 8 1 0 0]\n [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]\n [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\n**image**\n\nI cannot display images directly.  The image would show the same grid as represented by the numpy array above, but with the color mapping applied: white (0) for most cells, azure (8) for some, and blue (1) for those locations where the transformation changed the pixel values.\n\n"
