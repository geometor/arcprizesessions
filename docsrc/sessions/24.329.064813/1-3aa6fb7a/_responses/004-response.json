There are several isolated azure pixels and at least two larger clusters. One cluster is at the top right, and another stretches vertically on the left side. The structure is more complex than the previous examples, with clusters of varying sizes and shapes.\n\n**Code Execution (Properties of Test Input):**\n\n"

If there are multiple, choose one arbitrarily.\n   - Change the selected azure pixel to blue (1).\n\n3. **Single-Pixel Clusters:** If a cluster contains only one azure pixel, leave it unchanged.\n\n\n**Code Execution (Validation of v2):**\n\nThe code below implements the refined natural language program (v2).\n\n"

While the algorithm is more sophisticated,  without the correct output for the test puzzle, it's difficult to definitively assess its accuracy.  The approach now prioritizes selecting pixels further from the cluster centroid and closer to the edges, which seems to align better with some observed patterns. Further refinement might still be needed, possibly incorporating additional heuristics based on cluster shape or size, which could help it to achieve higher accuracy.  More examples would be very beneficial to further improve the algorithm's performance.\n"
