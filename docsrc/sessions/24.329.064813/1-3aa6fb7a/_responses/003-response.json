            "text": "The transformation consistently involves changing a subset of azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The changed pixels are always adjacent to other azure pixels, suggesting a rule based on adjacency and cluster proximity. The selection of *which* adjacent azure pixel to change appears to be somewhat arbitrary, but there's a tendency to select pixels that are below or to the left of other azure pixels within a cluster. This needs more examples to confirm.\n\nLet's summarize the observations and develop a natural language program that attempts to capture the transformation:\n\n**Natural Language Program (v1):**\n\n1. Identify all clusters of connected azure (8) pixels.  Two azure pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).\n\n2. For each cluster:\n   - If the cluster contains more than one azure pixel, select one azure pixel within the cluster that is adjacent to at least one other azure pixel.  Prioritize selecting a pixel that is located below or to the left of other azure pixels within the cluster (if such a pixel exists).\n   - Change the selected azure pixel to blue (1).\n\n3. If a cluster contains only one azure pixel, leave it unchanged.\n\n\n**Code Execution (Validation of v1):**\n\nThe following code implements the natural language program (v1) and attempts to replicate the transformations in the provided examples.  It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify connected components (clusters).\n\n"
