The working output grid shows that three azure pixels have been changed to blue. This is consistent with the observation that the transformation replaces one azure pixel per cluster (excluding single-azure-pixel clusters) with a blue pixel.  Let's verify this using code execution:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from collections import deque

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                             [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                             [8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],
                             [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   def count_clusters(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
       count = 0
       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                   count += 1
                   queue = deque([(r,c)])
                   visited[r,c] = True
                   while queue:
                       row, col = queue.popleft()
                       for dr, dc in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]:
                           nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                           if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr,nc] == 8 and not visited[nr, nc]:
                               visited[nr, nc] = True
                               queue.append((nr, nc))
       return count

   print(f"Number of azure pixels: {np.count_nonzero(working_output == 8)}")
   print(f"Number of blue pixels: {np.count_nonzero(working_output == 1)}")
   print(f"Number of azure clusters: {count_clusters(working_output)}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Number of azure pixels: 9
   Number of blue pixels: 3
   Number of azure clusters: 3

The output confirms that there are 3 blue pixels and 9 azure pixels, and 3 azure clusters in the working output grid.  This is consistent with the pattern we have observed.  Each cluster with more than one azure pixel has one azure pixel changed to blue.  The single-azure-pixel clusters remain unchanged.  Without the correct solution, I can't be certain this is correct, but it does follow the rules consistently applied in the preceding examples.  More examples would provide a more rigorous test.
