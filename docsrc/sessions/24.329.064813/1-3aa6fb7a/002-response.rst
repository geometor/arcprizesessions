The input grid for example 2 shows several clusters of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, but several azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  Each blue pixel appears adjacent to, and below or to the left of, a remaining azure pixel within the same cluster.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences found at coordinates: {diff}")
   print(f"Input grid shape: {input_grid.shape}")
   print(f"Number of azure pixels in input: {np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 8)}}")
   print(f"Number of blue pixels in output: {np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 1)}")

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Differences found at coordinates: (array([1, 2, 5]), array([4, 3, 3]))
   Input grid shape: (7, 7)
   Number of azure pixels in input: 10
   Number of blue pixels in output: 3

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 10
     objects:
       - size: 10, position: scattered, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 7
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 7, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three azure pixels changed to blue. Each blue pixel is below or to the left of a cluster of azure pixels.
   transformation:
     -  Similar to example 1, a subset of azure pixels changes to blue.  The transformation seems to target azure pixels that are adjacent to other azure pixels, but the selection is more complex and might be based on the overall cluster's shape.

Based on the two examples, the transformation appears to select a subset of azure pixels within each cluster to change to blue. The selection criteria seem to favor pixels adjacent to other azure pixels, and potentially also considers positional relationships within the cluster (below or to the left).  More examples would help refine the natural language program and clarify any ambiguities in the selection process.
