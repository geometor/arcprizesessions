The rule for replacement appeared to depend on the number of gray (5) neighbors for each pixel.  However,  the simple adjacency check in the previous code was insufficient.  A more sophisticated approach is required.\n\n**Code Execution (Neighborhood Analysis Refinement):**\n\nThis refined code attempts to better capture the relationship between the number of gray neighbors and the color assignment in the output grid.\n\n"

Note that even this refined solution might not be perfect without additional examples or a more detailed specification of edge handling.  The current solution uses a heuristic to handle edge cases based on the limited example set.\n\n\n**Final Report:**\n\nThe transformation replaces gray (5) shapes with similar shapes using light blue (8) and red (2). The rule seems to be based on a refined neighborhood analysis, considering the number of adjacent gray pixels.  Pixels with 0 or 1 gray neighbors become red.  Pixels with 2 gray neighbors become red (this may need further refinement based on additional data). Pixels with 3 or more gray neighbors become light blue.  Edge cases require careful consideration, and a more formal rule might be needed for perfect accuracy.  The presented `transform_grid_refined` function provides a good approximation but may require further refinement depending on unseen edge cases.\n"
