Gray pixels are replaced with light blue and red pixels in a pattern that seems consistent but the exact rule is still unclear. The overall shape is preserved.\n```\n\n**Ruminate Phase:**\n\nFrom the three examples, we observe a consistent pattern:  A shape composed of gray (5) pixels in the input grid is transformed into a similar shape in the output grid.  The gray pixels are replaced by a combination of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels.  The exact replacement pattern seems to depend on the local neighborhood of each gray pixel and potentially its position within the overall shape.  The examples suggest that edge pixels and corner pixels of the gray shapes are treated differently than interior pixels.  More examples are needed to definitively determine the rule governing the replacement.  However, based on these three, I hypothesize a rule involving simple adjacency checks (checking for neighbors of value 5) to determine whether a pixel becomes red or light blue.\n\n\n**Natural Language Program (Hypothetical):**\n\n1. **Identify Gray Blob:** Locate all connected components of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.\n2. **Iterate Through Gray Pixels:** For each gray pixel:\n    * **Check Neighbors:** Determine the number of neighboring pixels (horizontally and vertically adjacent) that are also gray (5).\n    * **Apply Replacement Rule:**\n        * If the number of gray neighbors is 0, 1, or 2, replace the pixel with red (2).\n        * If the number of gray neighbors is 3 or more, replace the pixel with light blue (8).\n3. **Output Grid:** The resulting grid with the modified pixels is the output.\n\n\n**Code Execution (Validation):**\n\nThis code requires more sophisticated logic to fully implement the described neighborhood analysis. The following is a starting point to illustrate an approach to analyzing neighborhoods,  but does not cover the full complexity required for all examples.\n\n"
