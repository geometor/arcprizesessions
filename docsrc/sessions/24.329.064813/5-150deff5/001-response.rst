The input grid shows a blob-like shape composed of gray pixels (value 5).  The output grid shows a similar shape, but the gray pixels have been replaced with a different pattern of light blue (value 8) and red (value 2) pixels. The overall shape and size of the blob remain consistent, only the internal pixel values change. The transformation seems to involve a local replacement rule, where each gray pixel is replaced based on its neighboring pixels, possibly maintaining some kind of adjacency structure.

     objects:
       - size: 21, position: centered, color: a mix of light blue and red, forming a similar shape
   differences:
     cells_changed: 21
     colors_changed: Gray pixels (5) are replaced with a mix of light blue (8) and red (2) pixels.
   transformation:
     - The gray blob is transformed into a similar-shaped blob, with gray pixels replaced by a pattern of light blue and red pixels. The pattern seems to depend on the local neighborhood of the original gray pixel.
