The input grid is a 3x3 grid with three colors: green (3), blue (1), and red (2), each color occupying a column. The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but with yellow (4), gray (5), and magenta (6) occupying the same respective columns.  The transformation appears to be a simple sequential replacement of colors, adding 1 to each color value.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[3, 1, 2],
                        [3, 1, 2],
                        [3, 1, 2]])

   output_grid = np.array([[4, 5, 6],
                         [4, 5, 6],
                         [4, 5, 6]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   # Check if the transformation is a simple addition of 1 to each cell value.
   transformed_grid = input_grid + 1
   print("\nTransformed Grid (input + 1):\n", transformed_grid)

   comparison = np.equal(transformed_grid, output_grid)
   print("\nComparison (Transformed Grid == Output Grid):\n", comparison)
   all_equal = np.all(comparison)
   print(f"\nAre all values equal? {all_equal}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 3: 3
       - 1: 3
       - 2: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: green
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,1), color: blue
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,2), color: red

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 4: 3
       - 5: 3
       - 6: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: yellow
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,1), color: gray
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,2), color: magenta

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All colors are changed sequentially.  Green becomes yellow, blue becomes gray, and red becomes magenta.

   transformation:
     - Add 1 to each color value.  This is not entirely accurate because the values are replaced with different colours, rather than simply incrementing the numbers in place. A more accurate description would be "replace each color with the next color in the sequence (green -> yellow, blue -> gray, red -> magenta)"

The code reveals that a simple addition of 1 to each cell isn't the transformation rule.  Instead, the transformation appears to be a sequential replacement of colors, where each color is replaced by the next color in a specific sequence (green -> yellow, blue -> gray, red -> magenta). This could be represented as a lookup table or a function mapping input colors to output colors.  The code didn't capture this because it treated the color values numerically rather than qualitatively.  A more sophisticated analysis is needed to account for the color mapping in order to capture the relationship completely.
