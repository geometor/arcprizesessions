The working output grid has been initialized to a 3x3 grid filled with 0s (white). This is consistent with the initialization step, preparing the grid for the color transformation.  The next step is to apply the color mapping derived from the training examples to this grid.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   working_output = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0]])

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3],
                         [8, 1, 3],
                         [8, 1, 3]])

   #Mappings extracted from previous examples
   test_mapping = {8: 9, 1: 5, 3: 4}

   # Apply the mapping to the working output grid
   for i in range(test_input.shape[0]):
     for j in range(test_input.shape[1]):
       working_output[i, j] = test_mapping[test_input[i, j]]

   print("Updated Working Output Grid:\n", working_output)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Updated Working Output Grid:
    [[9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]
    [9 5 4]]

The code successfully applies the color mapping to the initialized working output grid, resulting in the predicted output grid.  The final output matches the predicted output from the earlier analysis.  The transformation is complete and correct.
