**observations**






The input grid is a 3x3 grid with three colors: green (3), blue (1), and red (2), each color occupying a column. The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but with yellow (4), gray (5), and magenta (6) occupying the same respective columns.  The transformation appears to be a simple sequential replacement of colors, adding 1 to each color value.

       - size: 3x1, position: (0,1), color: blue

   output:

     height: 3
     colors:
       - 4: 3
       - 5: 3
       - 6: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: yellow
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,1), color: gray
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,2), color: magenta

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All colors are changed sequentially.  Green becomes yellow, blue becomes gray, and red becomes magenta.

   transformation:
     - Add 1 to each color value.  This is not entirely accurate because the values are replaced with different colours, rather than simply incrementing the numbers in place. A more accurate description would be "replace each color with the next color in the sequence (green -> yellow, blue -> gray, red -> magenta)"

The code reveals that a simple addition of 1 to each cell isn't the transformation rule.  Instead, the transformation appears to be a sequential replacement of colors, where each color is replaced by the next color in a specific sequence (green -> yellow, blue -> gray, red -> magenta). This could be represented as a lookup table or a function mapping input colors to output colors.  The code didn't capture this because it treated the color values numerically rather than qualitatively.  A more sophisticated analysis is needed to account for the color mapping in order to capture the relationship completely.

**observations**






The input grid is a 3x3 grid containing three colors: red (2), green (3), and azure (8), each occupying a column.  The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but the colors have changed. Red (2) has become magenta (6), green (3) has become yellow (4), and azure (8) has become maroon (9).  The transformation appears to be a non-sequential mapping of input colors to output colors, unlike the first example.

   input_grid = np.array([[2, 3, 8],
                        [2, 3, 8],

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All colors are changed. Red becomes magenta, green becomes yellow, and azure becomes maroon.

   transformation:
     - A color mapping is applied.  Red (2) maps to magenta (6), green (3) maps to yellow (4), and azure (8) maps to maroon (9).  This is a non-sequential mapping.

The code confirms that a direct color mapping is the transformation rule. Each input color is replaced with a specific output color according to a predefined mapping.  There is no arithmetic or sequential relationship between the input and output values.

The input grid is a 3x3 grid consisting of gray (5), azure (8), and magenta (6) each in a column. The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but now contains blue (1), maroon (9), and red (2) in the same respective columns.  The transformation again seems to be a color mapping, but a different one than in example 2.

   differences:

     colors_changed: All colors are changed. Gray becomes blue, azure becomes maroon, and magenta becomes red.

   transformation:
     - A color mapping is applied. Gray (5) maps to blue (1), azure (8) maps to maroon (9), and magenta (6) maps to red (2).

The code confirms a color mapping is in operation; however, a different mapping than in example 2 is used for this example.  There's no consistent arithmetic or sequential pattern across the mappings.  Each example appears to have a unique color mapping.

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All colors are changed. Maroon becomes azure, yellow becomes green, and red becomes magenta.

   transformation:
     - A color mapping is applied. Maroon (9) maps to azure (8), yellow (4) maps to green (3), and red (2) maps to magenta (6).

The code confirms that a color mapping is the transformation rule.  Each input color is replaced by a specific output color; however, the mapping is unique to this example, just as in previous examples.  There's no single, consistent mathematical or sequential rule across all four examples besides the application of a unique color mapping for each input grid.






**examples summary**






The transformation applied to each input grid involves a unique color mapping. There's no consistent arithmetic operation or sequential pattern across the examples.  Each input grid is transformed by a different mapping that replaces each color with a specific, new color.  The mapping is not based on any discernible numerical relationship between the input and output color values.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Example 1: All values match output? True
   Example 2: All values match output? True
   Example 3: All values match output? True
   Example 4: All values match output? True

The code confirms that each example can be solved with a unique color mapping.  The absence of a generalizable numerical or sequential pattern across the mappings suggests that the puzzle requires memorizing or learning individual mappings rather than inferring a general rule.  The challenge seems to be focused on pattern recognition of specific color associations.
