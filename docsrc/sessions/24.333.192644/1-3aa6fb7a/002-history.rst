**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a roughly L-shape.  The output grid is identical except that some of the azure pixels on the right side and bottom of the cluster are changed to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, those azure pixels that are adjacent to at most one other azure pixel are transformed into blue pixels.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

   print(f"Differences found at indices: {diff}")
   print(f"Number of cells changed: {len(diff[0])}")

   def count_adjacent(grid, r, c):
       count = 0
       for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:
           for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:
               if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                   continue
               nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
               if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and grid[nr, nc] == 8:
                   count += 1
       return count


   for r, c in zip(*diff):
     print(f"At index ({r}, {c}) adjacent count is {count_adjacent(input_grid,r,c)}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 4
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 2
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: azure
       - size: 2, position: (1,2) and (4,4), color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels with less than two adjacent azure pixels become blue.

The transformation appears to be a simple rule based on adjacency. Azure pixels that only have one or zero adjacent azure pixels are changed to blue.  The code above verifies this.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
