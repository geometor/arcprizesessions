**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels arranged in a roughly L-shape.  The output grid is identical except that some of the azure pixels on the right side and bottom of the cluster are changed to blue (1) pixels. Specifically, those azure pixels that are adjacent to at most one other azure pixel are transformed into blue pixels.

     objects:

       - size: 2, position: (1,2) and (4,4), color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels with less than two adjacent azure pixels become blue.

The transformation appears to be a simple rule based on adjacency. Azure pixels that only have one or zero adjacent azure pixels are changed to blue.  The code above verifies this.

**observations**






The input grid in example 2 is similar to example 1, containing a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid shows the same cluster, but some azure pixels have been replaced with blue (1) pixels.  The pattern seems consistent with the first example: azure pixels with fewer than two adjacent azure pixels are transformed into blue pixels.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],

       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
     objects:

   output:
     width: 7

     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 3
       - 1:3
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: scattered, color: azure
       - size: 3, position: scattered, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: 3 azure pixels changed to blue.
   transformation:
     - Azure pixels with fewer than two adjacent azure pixels become blue.

The code shows that the changes are occurring at positions where the number of adjacent azure pixels is at least 2.  This confirms my hypothesis. The natural language program for the transformation is: "Change any azure pixel to blue if it has fewer than two adjacent azure pixels".






**examples summary**






The transformation rule observed in both examples is consistent:  Azure (8) pixels that have fewer than two adjacent Azure pixels are changed to Blue (1) pixels.  Adjacency includes diagonal neighbors.

   Azure pixel at (0, 5) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (0, 6) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (1, 0) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (1, 1) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (1, 6) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (2, 0) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (3, 3) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (4, 3) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (4, 4) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (5, 1) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (6, 0) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.
   Azure pixel at (6, 1) has 2 adjacent azure pixels.






Based on the analysis of the previous examples and the application of the derived transformation rule to the test input, the predicted output is as follows:

Since all azure pixels in the test input have at least two adjacent azure pixels, none will be changed to blue.  Therefore, the output grid will be identical to the input grid.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.copy(input_grid) #No changes predicted

   print(f"Predicted output:\n{output_grid}")

   Predicted output:
   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]






**Final Answer:** The output grid is identical to the input grid because no azure pixels meet the criteria for transformation (having fewer than two adjacent azure pixels).






**initialize the working output grid:**






====






INSTRUCTIONS:






use function_call to initialize the working output grid:


* initialize_output_from_input: good when examples show few differences between
  input and output
* initialize_output_by_size: create a fresh grid from size and color
