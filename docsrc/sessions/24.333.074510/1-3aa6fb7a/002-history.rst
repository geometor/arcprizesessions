**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of azure (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the azure pixels bordering white pixels have been changed to blue (1) pixels.  It seems like a rule of replacement based on adjacency.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f"Differences at indices: {diff}")

   azure_count_input = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 8)
   blue_count_output = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 1)
   print(f"Azure count in input: {azure_count_input}")
   print(f"Blue count in output: {blue_count_output}")






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Differences at indices: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))
   Azure count in input: 6
   Blue count in output: 2






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-bottom, color: azure

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
       - 1:2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-bottom, color: azure
       - size: 2, position: near azure, color: blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 azure pixels changed to blue.

   transformation:
     - Azure pixels adjacent to white pixels are changed to blue.

The code shows that two cells changed from azure to blue.  The transformation appears to be a simple replacement of azure pixels that are adjacent to white pixels with blue pixels.  There is no apparent pattern other than this adjacency.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
