The current ``working output grid`` is incorrect because it only reflects a partial application of the transformation rule. The rule states that *all* azure (8) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels should change to blue (1). The current grid only shows one such change.  However, the code correctly identifies all such pixels. The problem is in the step-by-step update process of the ``working output grid``. The ``transform_grid`` function, however, provides a more reliable and comprehensive way to apply the transformation in one step, ensuring all necessary changes are made. Therefore, I will use the output from the ``transform_grid`` function for my final answer.

Final Answer:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]
