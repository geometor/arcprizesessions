Only two pixels have been changed to blue (1), while the transformation rule dictates that *all* azure (8) pixels orthogonally adjacent to white (0) pixels should be changed.  The step-by-step updates are not consistently applying the rule.\n\nThe `transform_grid` function, however, reliably and completely applies the transformation. Therefore, I will use its output as the final answer.  There is no need for additional code execution or review, as the previously executed code sufficiently demonstrated the accuracy and completeness of the `transform_grid` function and its output.\n\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n```\n[[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]\n [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]\n [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]\n [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]\n [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n"
