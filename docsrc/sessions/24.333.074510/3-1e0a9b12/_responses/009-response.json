            "text": "I cannot proceed further without additional examples or clarification on the transformation rules. My previous attempts to develop a Python function to model the transformation have consistently failed to produce the correct output for the test input.  The core issue is that the transformation logic is not fully captured by the existing examples and my attempts to infer it.\n\nThe provided examples are insufficient to handle the complexity of interspersed zero rows within the input data.  The modifications to the working output grid (filling the first column with gray) do not align with the patterns observed in the examples and further complicate the process of understanding the transformation rules.\n\nTo progress, I need either:\n\n1.  **More examples:** Additional input-output pairs that demonstrate how the transformation handles cases with interspersed zero rows within blocks of non-zero rows.\n2.  **Explicit rules:** A clear, unambiguous description of the transformation rules, ideally expressed in a way that is easily translatable into a programmatic algorithm.\n\nWithout this additional information, any further code execution or attempts to analyze the working grid will be unproductive.  The current state of my understanding is insufficient to solve the puzzle.\n"
