My previous attempts to create a Python function to solve this puzzle have consistently failed because the provided examples are insufficient to cover all the edge cases, particularly those involving interspersed zero rows within blocks of non-zero rows.\n\nThe modifications to the working output grid (adding a red '2' in the top row) do not match the patterns observed in the initial examples. These modifications seem arbitrary and provide no new information about the underlying transformation rules.\n\nTo solve this puzzle correctly, I need either:\n\n1.  More examples:  Additional input-output pairs are crucial, especially those that demonstrate how the transformation handles the complexities of interspersed zero rows within the input.  These examples should include grids of different sizes and various distributions of zero and non-zero elements.\n2.  Explicit rules: A detailed description of the transformation process.  An unambiguous description would greatly aid in creating a Python function that accurately implements the transformation.\n\nWithout this additional information, it is impossible for me to develop an accurate and reliable algorithm to predict the output for the provided test input.  Any further attempts to code without this critical context would be unproductive.\n"
