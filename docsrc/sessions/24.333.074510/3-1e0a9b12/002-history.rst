**observations**






The input grid is a 4x4 grid containing the colors blue, yellow, pink, and maroon.  The output grid is also a 4x4 grid. The non-zero values from the input grid appear in the bottom row of the output grid, in the same order as they appear in the input grid's last row, while maintaining their position within the row. The rest of the output grid is filled with white.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 4, 0, 9],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 4, 6, 0],
                         [1, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 4, 0, 0],
                          [1, 4, 6, 9]])

   print("Input Grid:")
   print(input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:")
   print(output_grid)

   # Identify non-zero elements and their positions in the input grid
   non_zero_indices = np.nonzero(input_grid)
   non_zero_elements = input_grid[non_zero_indices]
   non_zero_positions = list(zip(non_zero_indices[0], non_zero_indices[1]))

   print("\nNon-zero elements and their positions in the input grid:")
   print(f"Elements: {non_zero_elements}")
   print(f"Positions: {non_zero_positions}")

   #Check if the non-zero elements in the last row of input are in the last row of the output grid
   last_row_input = input_grid[-1,:]
   last_row_output = output_grid[-1,:]
   print(f"\nLast row input:{last_row_input}")
   print(f"Last row output:{last_row_output}")

   Last row output:[1 4 6 9]






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 4
     height: 4
     colors:
       - 0: 12
       - 4: 2
       - 9: 1
       - 6: 1
       - 1: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (0,3), color: maroon
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (2,2), color: pink
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue

   output:
     width: 4
     height: 4
     colors:
       - 0: 12
       - 4: 2
       - 9: 1
       - 6: 1
       - 1: 1
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,0), color: blue
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,1), color: yellow
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,2), color: pink
       - size: 1x1, position: (3,3), color: maroon

   differences:
     cells_changed: 8
     colors_changed: The non-zero elements from the last row of the input grid are moved to the last row of the output grid, maintaining their order and position within the row. The rest of the grid is filled with white.
   transformation:
     - The non-zero values from the last row of the input are moved to the last row of the output, maintaining their original relative positions.
     - All other cells are set to zero (white).

The transformation rule appears to be: Take the non-zero elements from the last row of the input grid and place them in the last row of the output grid, maintaining their order and position. All other cells in the output grid are set to zero.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
