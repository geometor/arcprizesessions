Here's an analysis of the provided test input grid, followed by a refined approach to the transformation rule and code to implement it.

**Review Examples Phase (Test Input)**

The test input grid presents several clusters of light-blue (8) pixels.  The clusters vary in size and position.  Applying the previously derived transformation rule (changing one adjacent light-blue pixel to blue in each cluster) requires a method to consistently select which pixel to change.

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   def count_clusters(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)
       cluster_count = 0

       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                   cluster_count += 1
                   q = [(r, c)]
                   visited[r, c] = True
                   while q:
                       curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)
                       neighbors = [(curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc) for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
                                     if 0 <= curr_r + dr < rows and 0 <= curr_c + dc < cols and grid[curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc] == 8 and not visited[curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc]]
                       for nr, nc in neighbors:
                           visited[nr, nc] = True
                           q.append((nr, nc))

       return cluster_count

   num_clusters = count_clusters(test_input)
   print(f"Number of clusters in the test input grid: {num_clusters}")

   Number of clusters in the test input grid: 4






There are 4 clusters in the test input.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 36
       - 8: 11
     objects:
       - size: 2, position: (0,5), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 3, position: (1,0), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (2,0), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (3,3), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 2, position: (4,3), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 2, position: (6,0), color: light-blue(8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0:36
       - 8: 7
       - 1: 4
     objects:
       - size: 1, position: (0,5), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (0,6), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 2, position: (1,0), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (2,0), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (3,3), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (4,3), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 2, position: (6,0), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (1,1), color: blue(1)
       - size: 1, position: (2,1), color: blue(1)
       - size: 1, position: (3,4), color: blue(1)
       - size: 1, position: (6,1), color: blue(1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 4
     colors_changed: 4 cells changed from light-blue (8) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - One light-blue (8) pixel in each cluster changes to blue (1).  The choice of which pixel to change within each cluster is arbitrary (as long as it is adjacent to another light-blue(8) pixel).

**Ruminate Phase**

The transformation consistently changes one light-blue pixel to blue within each cluster.  To make the transformation deterministic, I'll modify the code to select the pixel with the lowest row index, then the lowest column index within that row,  among the adjacent light-blue pixels.

**Code Execution (Revised)**

.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid_deterministic(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)

       for r in range(rows):
           for c in range(cols):
               if grid[r, c] == 8 and not visited[r, c]:
                   cluster = []
                   q = [(r, c)]
                   visited[r, c] = True
                   while q:
                       curr_r, curr_c = q.pop(0)
                       cluster.append((curr_r, curr_c))
                       neighbors = [(curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc) for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
                                     if 0 <= curr_r + dr < rows and 0 <= curr_c + dc < cols and grid[curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc] == 8 and not visited[curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc]]
                       for nr, nc in neighbors:
                           visited[nr, nc] = True
                           q.append((nr, nc))

                   if cluster:
                       # Select the pixel with the lowest row index, then lowest column index
                       change_r, change_c = min(cluster, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
                       new_grid[change_r, change_c] = 1

       return new_grid

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   output_grid = transform_grid_deterministic(test_input)
   print(output_grid)






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 8 0 0 0 0 8]
    [8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]






The deterministic code produces a consistent output for the test input.  The transformation rule is now clearly defined and consistently applied.  The output shows one light-blue pixel changed to blue in each cluster, with the selection criteria being the lowest row and column index among adjacent light-blue pixels.
