The input grid contains a collection of light blue (8) pixels scattered across the grid. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the light blue (8) pixels have been changed to blue (1).  The transformation appears to target isolated light blue pixels.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid_1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],

.. code-block::

   Input Grid 1:
    [[0 0 0 0 8 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 8 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

   Output Grid 1:
    [[0 0 0 0 8 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 8 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 8 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]

   Differences 1:
    [(np.int64(1), np.int64(4)), (np.int64(2), np.int64(3)), (np.int64(5), np.int64(3))]
   Pixel at (1,4) is adjacent to another 8. Should not be changed.
   Pixel at (2,3) is adjacent to another 8. Should not be changed.
   Pixel at (5,3) is adjacent to another 8. Should not be changed.






The code execution shows that the ``is_adjacent`` function is not correctly identifying all adjacent pixels.  The error messages indicate pixels that should not have been changed (because they were adjacent to other 8s) were changed. Therefore, a more sophisticated approach is needed to handle adjacency accurately.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 39
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: scattered, color: light blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 39
       - 8: 4
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: scattered, color: light blue (8)
       - size: 2, position: scattered, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 cells changed from light blue (8) to blue (1)

   transformation:
     - Identify all light blue (8) pixels.
     - For each light blue (8) pixel, check if it's adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to another light blue (8) pixel.
     - If it's NOT adjacent to another light blue (8) pixel, change its color to blue (1).
