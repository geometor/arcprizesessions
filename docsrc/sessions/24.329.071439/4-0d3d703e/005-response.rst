Ruminate Phase
--------------

All four examples present the same pattern. The input grids consist of three columns, each of a single color. The output grids are the same size as the input grids, also with three columns, and each column is a single color. The transformation in each example is the same: each color in the input grid is mapped to a specific color in the output grid. Each example provides a unique color mapping.

The transformation rule in all examples is a direct color mapping. The input colors are replaced with corresponding output colors according to a consistent mapping table, specific to each example. 

**Natural language program**

For the test grid, identify the color values in each of the three columns of the input grid. Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid. Apply the color mapping based on the learned mappings in the examples: for each cell in the input grid, replace its color with the corresponding color defined in the mapping table for that example. The resulting output grid will have three columns, each filled with a single, mapped color.

To confirm the natural language program I will check for consistent mappings across all examples, then run the program in code_execution on the test input after it's revealed.

**Summary of color mappings**


* Example 1: 3->4, 1->5, 2->6
* Example 2: 2->6, 3->4, 8->9
* Example 3: 5->1, 8->9, 6->2
* Example 4: 9->8, 4->3, 2->6

I note that there is some overlap in mappings. This further supports the consistency of the transformation program - colors map to the same output across examples:


* 2 maps to 6 in examples 1, 2, and 4
* 3 maps to 4 in examples 1 and 2
* 8 maps to 9 in examples 2 and 3

This suggests a global mapping rule, though the provided examples do not fully define this rule. For the test puzzle, we should apply the specific mapping based on the test input's color values, following the pattern observed in the examples.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   # Example mappings
   example_mappings = [
       {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6},
       {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9},
       {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2},
       {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}
   ]

   # Check for consistent mappings
   consistent_mappings = {}
   for mapping in example_mappings:
       for in_val, out_val in mapping.items():
           if in_val in consistent_mappings:
               if consistent_mappings[in_val] != out_val:
                   print(f"Inconsistency found for {in_val}: {consistent_mappings[in_val]} vs {out_val}")
           else:
               consistent_mappings[in_val] = out_val

   print("Consistent mappings found (if no inconsistencies were reported above):")
   print(consistent_mappings)

code_execution_result: 1

.. code-block:: text

   Consistent mappings found (if no inconsistencies were reported above):
   {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6, 8: 9, 5: 1, 6: 2, 9: 8, 4: 3}

This confirms the mapping is consistent.
