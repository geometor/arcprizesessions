The output grid in each case is a 3x3 square with a specific pattern of 2s (red) and 0s (white). \n\nThe transformation consistently involves:\n1. **Size reduction:** The input grid of 3x7 is reduced to a 3x3 output grid.\n2. **Color replacement:** The 5s (gray) in the central column and 1s (blue) elsewhere are replaced with 2s (red) and 0s (white). \n3. **Pattern detection:** The placement of the 2s (red) in the output grid seems to depend on the position of 1s (blue) adjacent to the 5s (gray) in the input grid.\n\n**Example 1:** A single 2 (red) is in the center of the 3x3 grid, regardless of the 1s (blue) around the 5s (gray).\n**Example 2:** A diagonal of 2s (red) appears in the 3x3 grid, indicating the placement might be related to the 1s (blue) adjacent to the 5s (gray) in any direction.\n**Example 3:** Two 2s (red) appear in the 3x3 grid, suggesting the placement might be related to the 1s (blue) specifically to the left of the 5s (gray) in the input grid.\n\nThe pattern seems to involve checking for the presence of 1s (blue) to the left of the 5s (gray) and replacing the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid with a 2 (red) if a 1 (blue) is found. \n\n## Natural Language Program\n\n**Transform the input grid by reducing its size to a 3x3 grid. For each row in the input grid, examine the cell immediately to the left of the central 5 (gray) cell. If that cell is 1 (blue), then the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid is set to 2 (red). All other cells in the output grid are set to 0 (white).**\n\n## Code Execution to Validate Natural Language Program\n\nTo further validate the natural language program, let's write a Python function that implements this transformation and test it on all three examples.\n\n"
