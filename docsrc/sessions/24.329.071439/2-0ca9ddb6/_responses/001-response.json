The original red and blue cells remain in place. \n\nThe new yellow cells appear in a specific pattern around the red cell. There are four yellow cells, two cells away in each cardinal direction from the red cell. The orange cells form a cross shape around the blue cell, one cell away in the cardinal directions and two diagonal cells adjacent to the blue. \n\n## Analysis\n\nI will use Python to analyze the grid to confirm and detail the observations made.\n\n"

Yellow cells appear two cells away from the red cell in the cardinal directions. Orange cells appear one cell away from the blue cell in the cardinal directions. This is a pattern of expansion from the original colored cells, with different distances and colors for each. \n\nTherefore, the natural language program for this transformation is:\n\n**For each red cell, place yellow cells two cells away in the north, south, east, and west directions. For each blue cell, place orange cells one cell away in the north, south, east, and west directions.** \n"
