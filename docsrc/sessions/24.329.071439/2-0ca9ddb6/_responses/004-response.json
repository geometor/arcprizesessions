For each blue cell, generate four orange cells located one unit away in the four cardinal directions. Existing non-zero cells are not overwritten by newly generated cells.**\n\n\n\n## Code Validation\n\nThe following code validates the natural language program by applying it to the input grids and checking if the resulting output matches the provided output grids.\n\n"

The generated output doesn't precisely match the expected output for the first example. Upon closer inspection, the issue lies in the handling of overlapping generated cells. While cells of other non-zero colors should not be overwritten, if an orange cell overlaps with the position where a yellow cell would be generated, the yellow cell should be placed. The original rule assumed that existing non-zero cells should never be overwritten. This needs to be corrected.\n\n\n\n## Refined Natural Language Program\n\n**For each red cell, generate four yellow cells located two units away in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). These yellow cells may overwrite empty cells or orange cells, but not cells of other colors. For each blue cell, generate four orange cells located one unit away in the four cardinal directions.
