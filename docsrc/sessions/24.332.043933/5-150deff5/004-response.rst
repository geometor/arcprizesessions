The examples demonstrate a consistent transformation rule. In each case, a gray (5) shape on a white (0) background is transformed into a shape with horizontal segments colored azure (8) and vertical segments colored red (2). The background remains white.

A horizontal segment is defined as consecutive gray cells in the same row.
A vertical segment is defined as consecutive gray cells in the same column.

Let's test this hypothesis with some code by implementing the transformation and applying it to the input grids.

   import numpy as np

   def transform(grid):
       output = grid.copy()
       rows, cols = np.where(grid == 5)
       for r, c in zip(rows, cols):
           horizontal = False
           vertical = False
           if c + 1 < grid.shape[1] and grid[r, c + 1] == 5:
               horizontal = True
           if r + 1 < grid.shape[0] and grid[r + 1, c] == 5:
               vertical = True

           if horizontal and not vertical:  # Prioritize horizontal if both are true
               output[r, c] = 8
           elif vertical:
               output[r, c] = 2
           # Case where neither is True - it is single and could be either. Since horizontal is
           # checked first, that's the tie-breaker.

               output[r,c] = 8

The code execution results do not match the examples provided. The logic for identifying horizontal and vertical segments is more complex than we anticipated since segments that are both horizontal and vertical are prioritized by horizontal by the current implementation. Let's refine the logic, focusing on connected components. A connected component will be a group of gray cells adjacent vertically or horizontally (not diagonally). Then the recoloring should apply to individual connected components, instead of just adjacent pairs, for more robustness.
