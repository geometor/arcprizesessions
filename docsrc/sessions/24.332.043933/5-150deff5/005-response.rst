**Test Input Grid Observation and Analysis**

The input grid for the test case shows another gray (5) figure on a white (0) background. This figure is a more disconnected variation of the "L" shape we've seen in the examples. It consists of several distinct segments. Some are clearly horizontal or vertical, while others might be considered both. There are several single gray pixels present as well.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   test_input_grid = np.array([
       [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   def count_colors(grid):
     colors, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
     return dict(zip(colors, counts))

   test_input_colors = count_colors(test_input_grid)

   print(f"Test Input Colors and Counts: {test_input_colors}")

   gray_positions = np.argwhere(test_input_grid == 5)
   print(f"Positions of Gray Pixels:\n{gray_positions}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 11
     height: 8
     colors:
       - 0: 64
       - 5: 24
     objects:
       - size: 24 position: scattered, color: gray

Based on the prior examples and code execution results, I believe the natural language program for this transformation is as follows:


#. 
   **Identify Connected Components:** Find all groups of connected gray pixels. Pixels are considered connected if they are directly adjacent horizontally or vertically.

#. 
   **Categorize Segments within Components:** For each connected component, categorize its segments as either horizontal or vertical. A segment is horizontal if it consists of at least two consecutive gray pixels in the same row. A segment is vertical if it consists of at least two consecutive gray pixels in the same column. Single, isolated gray pixels can be classified arbitrarily as either horizontal or vertical—they will remain as single units.

#. 
   **Recolor:** Recolor all pixels belonging to horizontal segments to azure (8). Recolor all pixels belonging to vertical segments to red (2).

Let's proceed to the prediction phase, using this refined logic to generate the output grid.
