Note that magenta appeared in the input, but I missed it in my first pass description - so it would appear the rule is to take the colored pixels in row-scan order and move them to the bottom row from left to right\n\n"

Specifically, we see there are 5 colored pixels in the input. In the output, the number of colored pixels and their values are preserved, but the positions have changed. The input colored positions are (0,1), (0,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), while the output colored positions are (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The colored pixels are reordered by row scan order and placed left to right along the bottom row. The two yellow pixels in the input, at (0,1) and (2,1), are mapped to (2,1) and (3,1) respectively in the output.
