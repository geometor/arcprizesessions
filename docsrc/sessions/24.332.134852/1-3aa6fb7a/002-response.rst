The input grid in example 2 shows a somewhat L-shaped cluster of light-blue (8) pixels.  The output grid is very similar, but some of the light-blue pixels that are on the edges of the cluster have been changed to blue (1).






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   print(f'{diff=}')
   changed_cells = len(diff[0])
   print(f'{changed_cells=}')

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: L-shaped cluster, color: light-blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 40
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 3
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: L-shaped cluster, color: light-blue (8)
       - size: 3, position: edges of light-blue cluster, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 3
     colors_changed: Three light-blue (8) cells changed to blue (1). These cells are located at the edges of the main light-blue cluster.
   transformation:
     - A subset of light-blue pixels on the edge of the light-blue cluster are changed to blue.  The number of changed pixels appears to be related to the perimeter of the light-blue cluster, possibly one pixel for each edge position.

Both examples show a transformation where a subset of light-blue pixels located at the edges of a cluster of light-blue pixels are changed to blue.  The number of pixels changed seems to be related to the perimeter of the light-blue cluster, but more examples would help to better understand the rule.
