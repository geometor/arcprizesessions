Okay, I've reviewed the changes in the working output grid and the rule.  The rule, as refined, focuses on the number of 8-neighbors for each 8-pixel. If an 8-pixel has 2 or fewer 8-neighbors, it's changed to a 1-pixel. Let's investigate further using code.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from scipy.ndimage import label, convolve

   def transform_grid(grid):
       light_blue_mask = grid == 8
       labeled_array, num_features = label(light_blue_mask)
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for label_num in range(1, num_features + 1):
           cluster_mask = labeled_array == label_num
           cluster_coords = np.where(cluster_mask)
           for r, c in zip(*cluster_coords):
               neighbors = grid[max(0, r - 1):min(grid.shape[0], r + 2), max(0, c - 1):min(grid.shape[1], c + 2)]
               num_8_neighbors = np.sum(neighbors == 8) - 1
               if num_8_neighbors <= 2:
                   new_grid[r, c] = 1
       return new_grid

   test_input = np.array([
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
   ])

   transformed_grid = transform_grid(test_input)
   print("Transformed Grid:\n", transformed_grid)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Transformed Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

The code confirms that the transformation has been applied correctly according to the refined rule.  The output matches the prediction.  I am ready for the next step.
