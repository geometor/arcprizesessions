**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of light-blue (8) pixels. The output grid is identical except one light-blue pixel has changed to blue (1) in each of two separate clusters.  It appears that a single light-blue pixel adjacent to other light-blue pixels changes to blue.






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

   diff = input_grid - output_grid
   print("Difference between input and output grids:\n", diff)

   changed_cells = np.count_nonzero(diff)
   print(f"\nNumber of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Identify the positions of changed cells
   changed_indices = np.where(diff != 0)
   print("\nIndices of changed cells:", changed_indices)

.. code-block::

   Difference between input and output grids:
    [[ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]

    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]]

   Number of cells changed: 2

   Indices of changed cells: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:

       - 0: 43
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: (1,1), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 2, position: (3,4), color: light-blue(8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 4, position: (1,1), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 2, position: (3,4), color: light-blue(8)
       - size: 1, position: (1,2), color: blue(1)
       - size: 1, position: (4,4), color: blue(1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 cells changed from light-blue (8) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - A single light-blue (8) pixel is changed to blue (1) in each cluster of light blue pixels.  The change occurs in pixels adjacent to other light-blue (8) pixels.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
