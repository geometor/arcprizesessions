The transformation rule is consistent across both examples:  In each cluster of adjacent light-blue (8) pixels, one light-blue pixel changes to blue (1). The chosen pixel is always adjacent to at least one other light-blue pixel. The selection of which specific pixel to change within a cluster seems arbitrary, as long as it's adjacent to another light-blue pixel.  There's no clear pattern determining which adjacent pixel is chosen for the change, but only one pixel per cluster is affected.

.. code-block::

   Transformed grid (Example 1):
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 8 8 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Transformed grid (Example 2):
    [[0 0 0 0 1 8 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 8 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 8 8 0 0 0]

    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]]






The code's output for Example 1 differs from the provided output. The code selects the topmost, leftmost 8 in the first cluster and transforms it into a 1.  The provided solution chooses a different 8 within the same cluster.  The same issue occurs in Example 2, the selection of the pixel to change is non-deterministic.  A more robust solution would need to define a consistent method for choosing the pixel within a cluster to modify.  For example, choosing the lowest index or a random selection could be considered.  The current implementation's arbitrariness leads to inconsistent results compared to the example outputs.
