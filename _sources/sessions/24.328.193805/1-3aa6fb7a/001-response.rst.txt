The input grid shows a cluster of light-blue (8) pixels. The output grid is identical except one light-blue pixel has changed to blue (1) in each of two separate clusters.  It appears that a single light-blue pixel adjacent to other light-blue pixels changes to blue.

       - size: 1, position: (1,2), color: blue(1)
       - size: 1, position: (4,4), color: blue(1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 cells changed from light-blue (8) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - A single light-blue (8) pixel is changed to blue (1) in each cluster of light blue pixels.  The change occurs in pixels adjacent to other light-blue (8) pixels.
