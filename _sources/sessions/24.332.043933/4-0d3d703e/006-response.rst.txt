The test input grid follows the same 3x3 structure as the training examples. The colors are azure (8), blue (1), and green (3). Based on the observed pattern, we expect the transformation to involve a color mapping specific to this puzzle.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   test_input = np.array([[8, 1, 3],
                          [8, 1, 3],
                          [8, 1, 3]])

   print(f"Test Input:\n{test_input}")
   print (f"Test Input shape: {test_input.shape}")
   input_colors = np.unique(test_input)
   print(f"Input colors: {input_colors}")

code_execution_result: 6

.. code-block::

   Test Input:
   [[8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]
    [8 1 3]]
   Test Input shape: (3, 3)
   Input colors: [1 3 8]

The test input is a 3x3 grid with colors 1, 3, and 8. We now need to predict the output based on the established pattern. Since there isn't a consistent arithmetic relationship, we have to look at each color individually and look for its transformation across the examples where they exist.


* **Color 1 (blue):** In Example 1, 1 maps to 4. In Example 3, there is no color 1 present. In Example 2, there is no color 1. In Example 4, there is no color 1. There's a precedence for 1 to map to 4.
* **Color 3 (green):** In Example 1, 3 maps to 6. In Example 2, 3 maps to 4. In Example 3, there is no color 3 present. In Example 4, 3 is an output color (from input 4). This presents conflicting output precedents and requires further analysis.
* **Color 8 (azure):** In Example 2, 8 maps to 9. In Example 3, 8 maps to 9. In Example 1, there is no color 8. In Example 4, 8 is an output color (from input 9). There's a precedence for 8 to map to 9.

Considering these observations, it's likely the color map is not based on simple mathematical rules but on an assigned map consistent within each puzzle. A plausible prediction for the output would be a mapping to 4, 6, and 9 for input values of 1, 3, and 8 respectively. This holds most closely to the prior examples, especially when considering the cases involving more than a single sample.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 3
       - 3: 3
     objects:
       - full grid - color 8
       - full grid - color 1
       - full grid - color 3
   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 9: 3
       - 4: 3
       - 6: 3
     objects:
       - full grid - color 9
       - full grid - color 4
       - full grid - color 6
   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: "8->9, 1->4, 3->6"
   transformation:
     - map each color in the input grid to a new color in the output grid. The color mapping is: 8->9, 1->4, 3->6.

**Prediction:**
