The working output grid currently shows a blue pixel at (1,2) which violates the established rule.  The rule is: "If an azure (8) pixel has a white (0) pixel directly below it, change the white pixel to blue (1)."

Let's verify this with code, specifically focusing on the changes made.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                         [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   working_output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                                  [8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8],
                                  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                                  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                                  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                  [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   rows, cols = input_grid.shape
   rule_violations = 0
   for i in range(rows - 1):
       for j in range(cols):
           if input_grid[i, j] == 8 and input_grid[i + 1, j] == 0 and working_output_grid[i + 1, j] != 1:
               rule_violations += 1
           elif input_grid[i, j] == 8 and input_grid[i + 1, j] == 0 and working_output_grid[i + 1, j] == 1:
               pass  # rule followed
           else:
               pass  # rule not applicable

   print(f'{rule_violations=}')

   #check for the specific change at (1,2)
   if input_grid[0,1] == 8 and input_grid[1,1] == 0 and working_output_grid[1,1] == 1:
       print("Rule followed for (1,2)")
   else:
       print("Rule violated for (1,2)")

   difference_grid = working_output_grid - input_grid
   print("\nDifference Grid:\n", difference_grid)

   changed_cells = np.sum(difference_grid != 0)
   print("\nNumber of cells changed:", changed_cells)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   rule_violations=0
   Rule violated for (1,2)

   Difference Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Number of cells changed: 2

The code confirms that the change at (1,2) is a violation.  The correct working grid should not have a blue pixel at (1,2).  The ``rule_violations`` count is 0 because the code only checks for violations of the rule, not for incorrect additions.  The ``Difference Grid`` shows that only two cells were changed, which is less than the six changes predicted by the rule application.  The correct final output grid should be:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
    [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 1 1 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]

This reflects the correct application of the rule.

**final output grid**

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 8 8]
    [8 8 0 0 0 1 8]
    [8 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 8 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 8 8 0 0]
    [0 8 0 1 1 0 0]
    [8 8 0 0 0 0 0]]
