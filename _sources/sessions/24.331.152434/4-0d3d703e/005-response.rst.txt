The transformation in all four examples is a deterministic color mapping.  Each input grid consists of a 3x3 arrangement of three distinct colors, each color occupying a single column. The output grid maintains the same 3x3 spatial arrangement, but each color from the input is replaced with a different color according to a specific mapping that is unique to each example. There is no change to the spatial distribution of colors. The mapping is one-to-one and consistent throughout the grid.

   import numpy as np

   examples = [
       (np.array([[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]), np.array([[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]])),
       (np.array([[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]), np.array([[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]])),
       (np.array([[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]), np.array([[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]])),
       (np.array([[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]), np.array([[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]))
   ]

   mappings = []
   for input_grid, output_grid in examples:
       mapping = {}
       for i in range(3):
           mapping[input_grid[0, i]] = output_grid[0, i]
       mappings.append(mapping)

   print("Mappings for each example:")
   for i, mapping in enumerate(mappings):
       print(f"Example {i+1}: {mapping}")

   # Check for commonalities or patterns in the mappings
   # (This part would require more sophisticated pattern recognition techniques
   # if the mappings were more complex or less obvious)

   Mappings for each example:
   Example 1: {np.int64(3): np.int64(4), np.int64(1): np.int64(5), np.int64(2): np.int64(6)}
   Example 2: {np.int64(2): np.int64(6), np.int64(3): np.int64(4), np.int64(8): np.int64(9)}
   Example 3: {np.int64(5): np.int64(1), np.int64(8): np.int64(9), np.int64(6): np.int64(2)}
   Example 4: {np.int64(9): np.int64(8), np.int64(4): np.int64(3), np.int64(2): np.int64(6)}






The code confirms that each example has a unique color mapping. There isn't an easily discernible pattern or rule governing these mappings across the examples.  Each mapping seems arbitrary.  To predict the output for a new input, one would need to identify the specific mapping rule applied to that particular input. There is no global, consistent mapping rule across all four examples.  The transformation is entirely determined by the specific mapping for the input.  Therefore, a general natural language program to describe this transformation is difficult to formulate.  A program would need to be created for each unique mapping rather than a general algorithm.

To reiterate: Each example represents a unique mapping and therefore a unique transformation story. There is no overarching rule to predict the transformation without knowing the specific color mapping used in the puzzle.
