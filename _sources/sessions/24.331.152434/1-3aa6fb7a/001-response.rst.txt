The input grid shows a cluster of light blue (8) pixels. The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the light blue pixels adjacent to a white pixel have changed to blue (1).  Specifically, the light blue pixels on the edges of the cluster seem to be the ones affected.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],

   print("Difference between input and output:\n", diff)

   # Count number of changed cells
   changed_cells = np.count_nonzero(diff)
   print(f"\nNumber of cells changed: {changed_cells}")

   #Identify changed cells locations
   changed_indices = np.where(diff != 0)
   print(f"\nIndices of changed cells: {changed_indices}")

.. code-block::

   Difference between input and output:
    [[ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0 -1  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]

    [ 0  0  0  0 -1  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
    [ 0  0  0  0  0  0  0]]

   Number of cells changed: 2

   Indices of changed cells: (array([1, 4]), array([2, 4]))






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 5
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-left, color: light blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 3
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 5, position: center-left, color: light blue (8)
       - size: 2, position: edges of light blue cluster, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: 2 cells changed from light blue (8) to blue (1).  These cells were on the edge of the light blue cluster and adjacent to white (0) cells.

   transformation:
     - If a light blue (8) cell is adjacent to a white (0) cell, change the light blue cell to blue (1).

The transformation appears to be a simple rule:  Light blue (8) cells that are adjacent to white (0) cells are changed to blue (1).  The code confirms that only two cells changed, both light blue to blue, and both at the edge of the initial light blue cluster.
