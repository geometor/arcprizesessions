The transformation rule is consistent across both examples:  Light blue (8) cells that are adjacent to white (0) cells are changed to blue (1). This rule applies to each light blue cell individually, regardless of the overall pattern or cluster size.

The code confirms this by identifying the changed cells and their locations, showing that only light blue cells adjacent to white cells are affected.  The number of cells changed varies depending on the input grid's arrangement of light blue cells and their proximity to white cells.

To summarize: The transformation is a local, edge-detection rule applying only to light blue pixels which are adjacent to a white pixel.

Let's test this hypothesis with a function:






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for i in range(rows):
           for j in range(cols):
               if grid[i, j] == 8:
                   #check for adjacent white cells
                   adjacent_white = False
                   for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
                       if 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols and grid[x, y] == 0:
                           adjacent_white = True
                           break
                   if adjacent_white:
                       new_grid[i, j] = 1
       return new_grid

   # Test with example 1
   example1_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   example1_output = transform_grid(example1_input)
   print("Example 1 transformed grid:\n", example1_output)


   # Test with example 2
   example2_input = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                             [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
                             [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]])

   example2_output = transform_grid(example2_input)
   print("\nExample 2 transformed grid:\n", example2_output)

.. code-block::

   Example 1 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Example 2 transformed grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 1 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 1 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]]






The code's output for example 1 and example 2  does not match the provided outputs. The function correctly identifies and transforms light blue cells adjacent to white cells, however it seems there is more to the transformation than just this single rule. There might be other conditions or rules that needs to be considered.  Further examples are needed to refine the transformation rule.
