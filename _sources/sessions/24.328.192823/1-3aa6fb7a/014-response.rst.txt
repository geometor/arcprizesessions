The previous attempts to update the working output grid were incorrect because they didn't consistently apply the transformation rule. The rule is:  A light blue (8) pixel changes to blue (1) *only if* it's adjacent to a white (0) pixel.  The previous updates incorrectly changed some (8) pixels to (1) when they weren't next to a (0).

Let's use ``code_execution`` to verify the correct transformation and ensure the working output grid is updated accurately.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(grid):
       rows, cols = grid.shape
       new_grid = np.copy(grid)
       for i in range(rows):
           for j in range(cols):
               if grid[i, j] == 8:
                   if (i > 0 and grid[i - 1, j] == 0) or \
                      (i < rows - 1 and grid[i + 1, j] == 0) or \
                      (j > 0 and grid[i, j - 1] == 0) or \
                      (j < cols - 1 and grid[i, j + 1] == 0):
                       new_grid[i, j] = 1
       return new_grid

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],
                        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)
   print("Correctly Transformed Grid:\n", output_grid)

   unique, counts = np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True)
   color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
   print("\nColor Counts:", color_counts)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block::

   Correctly Transformed Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Color Counts: {0: 27, 1: 16}

The ``transform_grid`` function correctly applies the transformation.  The final output grid should be:

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 1]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

This grid has 27 white (0) pixels and 16 blue (1) pixels, correctly reflecting the transformation.  No light blue (8) pixels remain because all adjacent to a white pixel have been changed to blue. The transformation is complete and consistent with the rule.  The working output grid should be updated to match this final, correctly transformed grid.
