   Transformed Grid:
    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

   Color Counts: {np.int64(0): np.int64(37), np.int64(1): np.int64(11), np.int64(8): np.int64(1)}






Reviewing the ``tool_code`` execution and the resulting ``transformed_grid``\ , I observe that the transformation rule has been correctly applied.  All light blue (8) pixels adjacent to a white (0) pixel have been changed to blue (1). The ``color_counts`` show 37 white pixels, 11 blue pixels, and 1 remaining light blue (8) pixel.  The single remaining light blue pixel wasn't changed because it doesn't have any adjacent white (0) pixels.  The working output grid needs to be updated to reflect this transformation.

**updated working output grid:**

.. code-block::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 8]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 1 0 0 0 0 0]]

**image**

(I can't display images directly. The image would show the grid above with white, blue, and one remaining light blue pixel.)

The changes are consistent with the transformation rule and the ``tool_code`` results.  The process is complete, unless further instructions are provided.
