This puzzle presents a grey shape on a white background in the input and a transformation of that shape into blue and red components in the output. 

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 11
     height: 9
     colors:
       0: 77
       5: 22
     objects:
       - irregular shape, grey, mostly central

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
     width: 11
     height: 9
     colors:
       0: 77
       8: 14
       2: 8
     objects:
       - irregular shape, discontinuous, blue and red

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: 22
     colors_changed: grey(5) to blue(8) and red(2)
   transformation:
     - grey pixels are replaced with blue and red pixels based on original position in the grey shape

In order to understand the transformation pattern, I will write a python script to analyze the positions of pixels and their color changes.

The python analysis shows that the grey pixels of the input are mapped to blue and red pixels in the output. The rule seems to be position-dependent.

Natural language program: For each grey pixel in the input grid, determine its position and map it to blue or red in the output grid based on a pattern that involves relative position within the grey shape.
Specific transformation rules that are emerging:


* The top left corner segment of the grey shape becomes blue.
* The lower and left-central portions of the grey shape become red.
* There seems to be a preference for the "left" and "top" parts to be blue, and the "right" and "bottom" parts to be red, but this needs further investigation with more examples.
