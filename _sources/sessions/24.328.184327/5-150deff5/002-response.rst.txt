This example again presents a grey shape on a white background transforming into blue and red components. The shape and pattern are different from the first example, providing additional data to refine the transformation rules.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 10
     height: 8
     colors:
       0: 58
       5: 22
     objects:
       - irregular shape, grey, mostly central-left

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
     width: 10
     height: 8
     colors:
       0: 58
       8: 12
       2: 10
     objects:
       - irregular shape, discontinuous, blue and red

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: 22
     colors_changed: grey(5) to blue(8) and red(2)
   transformation:
     - grey pixels are replaced with blue and red pixels based on original position in the grey shape. The pattern seems to alternate horizontally in the top section and shows vertical splits in the bottom section

I will use a python script to further analyze the positional changes and color mappings.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   grey_positions = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)
   blue_positions = np.argwhere(output_grid == 8)
   red_positions = np.argwhere(output_grid == 2)

   print("Grey positions:", grey_positions)
   print("Blue positions:", blue_positions)
   print("Red positions:", red_positions)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block:: text

   Grey positions: [[1 1]
    [1 2]
    [1 3]
    [1 4]
    [1 5]
    [1 6]
    [2 1]
    [2 2]
    [2 3]
    [2 4]
    [2 5]
    [2 6]
    [3 3]
    [3 6]
    [4 4]
    [4 5]
    [4 6]
    [5 4]
    [5 5]
    [5 6]
    [6 4]
    [6 5]]
   Blue positions: [[1 1]
    [1 2]
    [1 4]
    [1 5]
    [2 1]
    [2 2]
    [2 4]
    [2 5]
    [4 5]
    [4 6]
    [5 5]
    [5 6]]
   Red positions: [[1 3]
    [1 6]
    [2 3]
    [2 6]
    [3 3]
    [3 6]
    [4 4]
    [5 4]
    [6 4]
    [6 5]]

The analysis shows a continuing pattern where the original grey pixels are transformed to blue or red based on position. The pattern seems to have horizontal alternations in the top rows and vertical splits in the lower parts.

Natural Language Program: For each grey pixel in the input, determine its position within the grey shape and convert it to blue or red based on a spatial pattern. The top section shows a horizontal alternating pattern (blue-blue-red-blue-blue-red) and the lower sections appear to be split vertically with left segments being red and right segments being blue.

Transformation Rules:


* In the top two rows, the pattern is Blue-Blue-Red-Blue-Blue-Red.
* Lower sections show vertical splitting, with red pixels generally on the left and blue pixels on the right where there's a choice. 
* Isolate segments seem to be red. 

This example reinforces the position-based transformation rule but introduces more complexity in the specific patterns. Further examples are needed to fully understand and generalize the rules.
