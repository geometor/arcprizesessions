This example continues the pattern of a grey shape transforming into blue and red pixels based on position within the shape. 

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 9
     height: 8
     colors:
       0: 48
       5: 14
     objects:
       - irregular shape, grey, central

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
     width: 9
     height: 8
     colors:
       0: 48
       2: 5
       8: 9
     objects:
       - irregular shape, discontinuous, blue and red

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: 14
     colors_changed: grey(5) to blue(8) and red(2)
   transformation:
     - grey pixels are replaced with blue and red pixels based on original position in the grey shape. The pattern appears to be horizontally defined in the top row and vertically defined in the lower rows.

Continuing the analysis with a python script to examine the positions of the pixels and color changes:

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   grey_positions = np.argwhere(input_grid == 5)
   blue_positions = np.argwhere(output_grid == 8)
   red_positions = np.argwhere(output_grid == 2)

   print("Grey positions:", grey_positions)
   print("Blue positions:", blue_positions)
   print("Red positions:", red_positions)

code_execution_result:

.. code-block:: text

   Grey positions: [[1 1]
    [1 2]
    [1 3]
    [1 4]
    [1 5]
    [2 4]
    [2 5]
    [3 3]
    [4 3]
    [4 4]
    [4 5]
    [5 3]
    [5 4]
    [5 5]]
   Blue positions: [[1 4]
    [1 5]
    [2 4]
    [2 5]
    [4 4]
    [4 5]
    [5 4]
    [5 5]]
   Red positions: [[1 1]
    [1 2]
    [1 3]
    [3 3]
    [4 3]
    [5 3]]

The analysis confirms that the grey pixels are transformed into blue and red pixels based on their positions. In the top row, the first three grey pixels become red, and the last two become blue. In the subsequent rows, there is a preference for the right side to be blue and the left side or isolated pixels to be red.

Natural Language Program: For each grey pixel, convert it to blue or red based on its position within the grey shape. The top row shows a clear division where the left portion becomes red and the right portion becomes blue. In lower rows, there is a tendency to assign red to the left and blue to the right, or to make isolated pixels red.

Transformation Rules:


* Top row: the first three pixels become red, the last two become blue.
* Lower rows: Left segments are generally red, right segments are blue.
* Isolated pixels tend to be red.

These examples consistently show a position-based transformation rule with the color change (grey to blue or red) determined by the specific location within the grey shape. While the exact patterns vary, there is a recurring theme of horizontal division in the top row and vertical division in the lower sections. This suggests a systematic approach to coloring based on spatial organization within the shape.
