The code successfully executed and generated the expected output for example 2, confirming the validity of the natural language program.

**Test Grid Analysis and Prediction**
The test input grid is 9x9 and contains red (color 2) at [3,2] and [7,7], blue (color 1) at [2,6], magenta (color 6) at [7,1], and azure (color 8) at [5,5].

Based on the natural language program, the following transformations should occur:


* The red pixels at [3,2] and [7,7] should be surrounded by yellow (color 4).
* The blue pixel at [2,6] should be surrounded by orange (color 7).
* The magenta (color 6) and azure (color 8) pixels should remain unchanged.

Let's predict the output grid using the ``transform_grid`` function defined in the previous code execution block.

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   def transform_grid(input_grid):
       # ... (same function as before) ...

   test_input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                              [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
                              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   predicted_output_grid = transform_grid(test_input_grid)
   print(predicted_output_grid)

       - 1x1 azure at [5,5]
       - 1x1 yellows around reds
       - 1x1 oranges around blue

   differences:
     cells_changed: 10
     colors_changed: Added yellow (4) and orange (7).
   transformation:
     Red cells get yellow orthogonal neighbors.
     Blue cells get orange orthogonal neighbors.
