**Example 3 Analysis**

The input grid is a 3x7 grid. It contains white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) pixels.  The gray pixels form a vertical line in the center. The blue pixels are somewhat clustered around the gray line but less densely than in the previous examples.

The output grid is a 3x3 grid.  It contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. Two red pixels are placed in the corners, at positions (1,0) and (2,2).

code_execution:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                         [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1],
                         [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                          [2, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 2]])

   print("Input Grid Shape:", input_grid.shape)
   print("Output Grid Shape:", output_grid.shape)

   print("\nInput Grid Color Counts:")
   for color, count in np.nditer(np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)):
       print(f"{color}: {count}")

   print("\nOutput Grid Color Counts:")
   for color, count in np.nditer(np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True)):
       print(f"{color}: {count}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 9
       - 1: 7
       - 5: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: center, color: gray
       - size: various, position: around central gray line, color: blue

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 0: 7
       - 2: 2
     objects:
       - size: 1x1, position: top-left and bottom-right corners, color: red

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: Gray and blue pixels are replaced with white, and two red pixels appear in opposite corners.
   transformation:
     - The input grid is reduced in size.
     - Two red pixels are placed in opposite corners of the output grid.
     - The remaining pixels are set to white.

The transformation in Example 3 is again a size reduction. The placement of the red pixels is different; they are now in opposite corners.  The natural language program is becoming more complex. A possible description could be: "Reduce the grid size; place red pixels in the top-left and bottom-right corners; fill remaining cells with white."  The relationship between the input and the placement of the red pixels requires further investigation.
