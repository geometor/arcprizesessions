The transformation consistently involves changing a subset of azure (8) pixels to blue (1) pixels.  The changed pixels are always adjacent to other azure pixels, suggesting a rule based on adjacency and cluster proximity. The selection of *which* adjacent azure pixel to change appears to be somewhat arbitrary, but there's a tendency to select pixels that are below or to the left of other azure pixels within a cluster. This needs more examples to confirm.

Let's summarize the observations and develop a natural language program that attempts to capture the transformation:

**Natural Language Program (v1):**


#. 
   Identify all clusters of connected azure (8) pixels.  Two azure pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent (horizontally or vertically).

#. 
   For each cluster:


   * If the cluster contains more than one azure pixel, select one azure pixel within the cluster that is adjacent to at least one other azure pixel.  Prioritize selecting a pixel that is located below or to the left of other azure pixels within the cluster (if such a pixel exists).
   * Change the selected azure pixel to blue (1).

#. 
   If a cluster contains only one azure pixel, leave it unchanged.

**Code Execution (Validation of v1):**

The following code implements the natural language program (v1) and attempts to replicate the transformations in the provided examples.  It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify connected components (clusters).

The code's output for Example 1 is different from the provided output. The algorithm's pixel selection isn't perfectly aligned with the example.  Example 2 also shows some discrepancies. The current ``select_pixel`` function is too simplistic.  It needs refinement to better capture the selection priority (below/left).  More examples are crucial for further improvement.  Additional heuristics, potentially based on cluster shape or size, might be needed for a more robust solution.
