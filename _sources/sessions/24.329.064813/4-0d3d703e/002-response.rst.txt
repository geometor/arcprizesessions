The input grid is a 3x3 grid containing three colors: red (2), green (3), and azure (8), each occupying a column.  The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but the colors have changed. Red (2) has become magenta (6), green (3) has become yellow (4), and azure (8) has become maroon (9).  The transformation appears to be a non-sequential mapping of input colors to output colors, unlike the first example.

   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[2, 3, 8],
                        [2, 3, 8],
                        [2, 3, 8]])

   output_grid = np.array([[6, 4, 9],
                         [6, 4, 9],
                         [6, 4, 9]])

   print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
   print("\nOutput Grid:\n", output_grid)

   #Attempting a color mapping
   color_map = {2:6, 3:4, 8:9}
   transformed_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

   for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
       for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
           transformed_grid[i,j] = color_map[input_grid[i,j]]

   print("\nTransformed Grid (color mapping):\n", transformed_grid)

   comparison = np.equal(transformed_grid, output_grid)
   print("\nComparison (Transformed Grid == Output Grid):\n", comparison)
   all_equal = np.all(comparison)
   print(f"\nAre all values equal? {all_equal}")

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 2: 3
       - 3: 3
       - 8: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: red
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,1), color: green
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,2), color: azure

   output:
     width: 3
     height: 3
     colors:
       - 6: 3
       - 4: 3
       - 9: 3
     objects:
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,0), color: magenta
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,1), color: yellow
       - size: 3x1, position: (0,2), color: maroon

   differences:
     cells_changed: 9
     colors_changed: All colors are changed. Red becomes magenta, green becomes yellow, and azure becomes maroon.

   transformation:
     - A color mapping is applied.  Red (2) maps to magenta (6), green (3) maps to yellow (4), and azure (8) maps to maroon (9).  This is a non-sequential mapping.

The code confirms that a direct color mapping is the transformation rule. Each input color is replaced with a specific output color according to a predefined mapping.  There is no arithmetic or sequential relationship between the input and output values.
