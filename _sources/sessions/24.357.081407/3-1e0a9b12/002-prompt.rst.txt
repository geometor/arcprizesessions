**observations**






INSTRUCTIONS:






above is a pair of example input and output grids 


* document your initial observations and impressions

  * begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
    grid

* 
  use ``code_execution`` to examine the grid information and verify the
  assumptions about size, colors, objects, and transformations. Focus your
  analysis on aspects like:


  * Counting the occurrences of each color.
  * How to identify the coordinates of pixels that have changed color or position.
  * Determining if the dimensions of the grid have changed.
  * Analyzing the count, size, shape, and relative positions of objects (contiguous
    blocks of the same color).

* 
  since the code you use may not be carried forward on following prompts, be
  sure to have the code print your findings in the output

* use what you learn to develop a natural language program of the
  transformation rule.
* review your findings and try to determine the natural language description of
  the transformation rule. How does the information captured in the YAML block
  inform your understanding of the transformation?

use a yaml block to capture details (examples):

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: X
     height: Y
     colors:
       - N: (count)
     objects:
       - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
     cells_changed: N
     colors_changed: desc
     transformation:
       - speculate on transformation rules

final step - provide a thorough natural language program
to tell another intelligent entity how to transform the input grid into the
output grid

You will examine and analyze the example grids

For each example pair, your goal is to derive a natural language description of
the transformation rule that explains how the input is changed to produce the
output. This "natural language program" should describe the steps or logic
involved in the transformation. 

the natural language program should be sufficient for an intelligent agent to
perform the operation of generating an output grid from the input, without the
benefit of seeing the examples. So be sure that the provide 


* context for understanding the input grid (objects, organization and important colors)
  particularly context for how to identify the 'objects'
* process for initializing the output grid (copy from input or set size and
  fill)
* describe the color palette to be used in the output
* describe how to determine which pixels should change in the output

For example, it might state: 


* copy input to working output
* identify sets of pixels in blue (1) rectangles in working grid
* identify to largest rectangle
* set the largest rectangle's pixels to red (2)

But remember - any information that describe the story of the transformations is
desired. Be flexible and creative.
