**observations**






The input grid shows a cluster of light-blue (color 8) pixels.  The output grid is almost identical, except that some of the light-blue pixels adjacent to other light-blue pixels have changed to blue (color 1).






code_execution:






.. code-block:: python


   import numpy as np

   input_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   output_grid = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])

   diff = np.where(input_grid != output_grid)
   changed_cells = list(zip(diff[0], diff[1]))
   print(f"Changed cells: {changed_cells}")

   input_count_8 = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 8)
   output_count_8 = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 8)
   output_count_1 = np.count_nonzero(output_grid == 1)

   print(f"Input count of 8: {input_count_8}")
   print(f"Output count of 8: {output_count_8}")
   print(f"Output count of 1: {output_count_1}")






code_execution_result: 1






.. code-block::

   Changed cells: [(np.int64(1), np.int64(2)), (np.int64(4), np.int64(4))]
   Input count of 8: 6
   Output count of 8: 6
   Output count of 1: 2






.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: light-blue (8)

   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       - 0: 43
       - 8: 6
       - 1: 2
     objects:
       - size: 6, position: center-left, color: light-blue (8)
       - size: 2, position: adjacent to light-blue cluster, color: blue (1)

   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: Two light-blue (8) cells changed to blue (1).
   transformation:
     - Some light-blue pixels adjacent to other light-blue pixels are changed to blue.

The transformation appears to involve changing the color of some light-blue pixels to blue. Specifically, it seems that light-blue pixels that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one other light-blue pixel are changed to blue.  The corners of the light-blue cluster are not affected.

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
