**observations**






The input grid is a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming two L-shapes. One L-shape is in the upper left quadrant and the other in the lower right quadrant. The output grid is also a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background, and azure (8) pixels forming the same L-shapes as the input. However, one pixel in each L-shape has been changed from azure (8) to blue (1). Specifically, the pixel that is at the "elbow" of each "L" has been changed to blue.

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       0: 37
       8: 12
     objects:
       - 3-pixel L-shape at (1,1) color azure
       - 3-pixel L-shape at (3,4) color azure
   output:
     width: 7
     height: 7
     colors:
       0: 37
       1: 2
       8: 10
     objects:
       - 3-pixel L-shape at (1,1) with elbow in blue, rest azure
       - 3-pixel L-shape at (3,4) with elbow in blue, rest azure
   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: azure (8) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - Identify L-shapes formed by azure pixels.
     - Locate the "elbow" pixel of each L-shape, defined as the pixel where the horizontal and vertical segments meet.
     - Change the color of the "elbow" pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

The natural language program for the transformation is:


#. **Identify L-Shapes:** Find all L-shaped groups of azure (8) pixels.
#. **Locate Elbow Pixels:** For each L-shape, find the pixel at the "elbow" where the vertical and horizontal segments meet. In this case the elbow pixel is adjacent to two azure pixels, and shares an edge with the object, but is not itself part of the L.
#. **Change Elbow Color:** Change the color of each identified "elbow" pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).

INSTRUCTIONS:






Review Examples Phase

pairs of input and output grids will be shown to you one at a time

you will examine and analyze the text and image for each example

you may use code execution with tools like numpy to examine patterns
after examining the grids, document the attributes of each as such

use a yaml block for the details

.. code-block:: yaml

   input:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   output:
   width: X
   height: Y
   colors:
     - N: (count)
   objects:
     - size, position and color - desc

.. code-block:: yaml

   differences:
   cells_changed: N
   colors_changed: desc
   transformation:
     - speculate on transformation rules

your response for this phase should contain the following content parts


* begin with a verbal description of your perception of the input and output
  grid
* run a ``code_execution`` part to test your perceptions - since the code you use
  may not be carried forward on following prompts, be sure to have the code
  print you findings in the output remember that you have access to many python
  libraries for analyzing the grids and validating patterns
* review your findings and try to determine what the natural language program
  is for the transformation
