The input grid is a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background and azure (8) pixels forming two L-shapes. One L-shape is in the upper left quadrant and the other in the lower right quadrant. The output grid is also a 7x7 grid with a white (0) background, and azure (8) pixels forming the same L-shapes as the input. However, one pixel in each L-shape has been changed from azure (8) to blue (1). Specifically, the pixel that is at the "elbow" of each "L" has been changed to blue.

   input:

       0: 37

     objects:

       - 3-pixel L-shape at (3,4) with elbow in blue, rest azure
   differences:
     cells_changed: 2
     colors_changed: azure (8) to blue (1)
   transformation:
     - Identify L-shapes formed by azure pixels.
     - Locate the "elbow" pixel of each L-shape, defined as the pixel where the horizontal and vertical segments meet.
     - Change the color of the "elbow" pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).

The natural language program for the transformation is:


#. **Identify L-Shapes:** Find all L-shaped groups of azure (8) pixels.
#. **Locate Elbow Pixels:** For each L-shape, find the pixel at the "elbow" where the vertical and horizontal segments meet. In this case the elbow pixel is adjacent to two azure pixels, and shares an edge with the object, but is not itself part of the L.
#. **Change Elbow Color:** Change the color of each identified "elbow" pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).
